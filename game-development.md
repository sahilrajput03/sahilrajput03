## vulkan guidance

Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform API, open standard for 3D graphics and computing. Vulkan targets high-performance real-time 3D graphics applications, such as video games and interactive media. It is highly perfomant for linux os. And unreal engine 5 has good support for it. But my laptop's graphic card doesn't support vulkan or may be drivers aren't made. 

```
# CHECK IF VULCAN IS WORKING:
# Install via yay:
sudo pacman -S vkcube-git
# usage: vkcube
## currently shows No Vulkan devices found.

- [Unity vs. unreal](https://unrealcommunity.wiki/differences-between-unity-and-unreal-b2c4rqwm)

The Render Hardware Interface (RHI) is an abstraction layer over several platform-specific graphics APIs. It is designed from the ground up to take advantage of DirectX 12, Vulkan, and Metal 2.0. 


## installing ver. 4.17

```bash
# Required dependency coz `setup.sh` fails.
yay -S qt4-bin

# Source: https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases
# Source: https://rhyce.dev/2019/05/02/compiling-unreal-engine-4-from-source/

./Setup.sh
./GenerateProjectFiles.sh
sudo chmod 700 ../currentFolder
sudo chown array -R ../currentFolder
make
./Engine/Binaries/Linux/UE4Editor
# If you’re getting any errors about Vulkan such as “Cannot find a compatible Vulkan device or driver.” just add -opengl4 as a launch parameter like so:
./Engine/Binaries/Linux/UE4Editor -opengl4
```
