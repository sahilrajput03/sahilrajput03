## `git pull` vs. `git pull origin` vs. `git pull origin main`

- You're working on a branch called `SD-499` which was checked out from main.
- Now main branch on the remote repository is updated.
- Now you do `git pull` or `git pull origin`, this will only fetch and merge all remote branches to their respective local branches which set set t to tracked.
- SO, now you need to merge `main` branch into your current branch either by doing `git merge main` or you can do it by `git pull origin main` as both will do same thing. **Why?** Ans. Because `git pull origin main` will pull update local main branch first and second it will merge `main` branch to your `currently checkout branch`. BECAUSE `git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge branch`. Source: [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull), [Git-scm](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull)

##  ‚ô•üíï‚ù§üòò You can literally move your `.git` folder any where

Yes, it sounds quite unbelievable but its quite magical how it does work actually. **Amazing Linus Torwald.**

Thats all.
