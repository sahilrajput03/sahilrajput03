# Single big mistakes I do often

## 1. RTFM (Read The Fucking Manual)

## 2. NOT SCHEDULING THE TASKS FROM THE TASK LIST

## 3. FEARING LIFE IS SHORT AND THUS NOT INVESTING TO THE FULL CAPACITY AND PLANNING FOR TOMORROW

## 4. Procrastination:

Fix procrastination by:

  - Divide task into two parts, and keep dividing each part into further two parts. And start doing each of these tasks.
  - Do the tasks right now which takes less than 5 mins.
