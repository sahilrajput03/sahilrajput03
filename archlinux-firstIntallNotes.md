# Readme

**Official archlinux installation guide**: [Click here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide).

_**Why do i make notes when i can use the same video _source/ article source_ to install in the same manner the way I did it in the first place ?**_ _Ans._ Bcoz textual information can be divided into precise points in the way I understand the intention of what I need to do. And though video content has high bandwidth in terms of absorbing content but textual content can be very much helpful and text notes are irreplacably good in my experience when it comes to 2-3 years of down the line when i need to do solve the same problem again.

## Installing from scratch

1. `dd if=pathToArchLinuxOS.iso of /dev/sda status=progress` : Setting up bootable pendrive. (if option means input file path). TIP: You can use `lsblk` _<stands for::listBlockDevices>_ to list all the devices plugged in at the moment.
2. `sudo su` to become root.
TIP: Please ensure that you have ***disabled*** `legacy mode` and `secure boot` features in your boot menu as it can cause problems in installation of the os.
3. `wifi-menu` to access wifi targets and connect to them (it is highly recommened).
4. `timedatectl set-ntp true` to set the time.
5. Now, we need to create partitions:
  
  ```
  # List all drives
  fdisk -l
  
  # Select your target device (hard drive)
  fdisk /dev/sdb # Considering sdb is your device.
  
  # Now you are in subshell of fdisk (use q to quit without saving any changes)
  
  # Common commands you can make use
  p : print the state of drive
  n : add a new partition
  d : delete a partition
  t : change partition type ## THIS MIGHT BE USEFUL LATER IF YOU CHOOSE UEFI INSTALLATION MODE to change the partition type of sdb1 to EFI.
  # FYI: UEFI IS BETTER THAN LEGACY
  
  # For fresh way of setting up(you may ensure that there are no current partition in the drive using `p` to print the partitions).
  # Make partition with `n` and press 1 to make it primary. Press <Enter> key for "First Sector", and type +200M for "Last Sector" to create a 200Mb partition. And type `y` to remove "Signature" then. Now use `p` to check if you got the partition there which you just made (this would show up as partition `sdb1`).
  
  ### /// now make another partition in similar way for the (SWAP partition for system hibernation purpose):
  # `n<Enter>p<Enter> +12G<Enter>   and now verify the same with p<Enter> (this would show up as partition `sdb2`)
  
  ### /// now create a partition for archlinux installation i.e., system partition:
  n<Enter>p<Enter>+25G<Enter>y<Enter>   and now verify the same with p<Enter> (this would show up as partition `sdb3`)
  
  ### /// now create a user data partition
  n<Enter>p<Enter><Enter>Y and now verify the same with p<Enter> (this would show up as partition `sdb4`)
  # FYI: We're using end block as end of the drive for the user data partition now.
  
  ####### Above process would make a partition table like below (You may use p<Enter> to print partition table)
                  type
  /dev/sdb1 200M  linux
  /dev/sdb2 12G   linux
  /dev/sdb3 25G   linux
  /dev/sdb4 260G  linux
  
  
  ### FINISHING??
  # Press w<Enter> to write the all new partition table to the drive at once.
  
  # Since its written now, you may verify the partition table simply with `lsblk` command now.
  ```
  
  6. Making file system for our _boot partition_, _system partition_ and _user data partition_ (We don't need to define filesystem for swap partition).
  
  ```
  # For UEFI: We need to make /dev/sdb1 of type EFI instead of ext4
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1 # IMPORTANT: READ ABOVE COMMENT
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb3
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb4
  ```
  
  7. Setting up swap partition
  ```
  mkswap /dev/sdb2
  swapon /dev/sdb2
  ```
  8. Mount partitions
  ```
  mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt
  # Check its content with `ls /mnt`. Also, `lsblk` would show the mount point in for our system partition too.
  
  # Create two directories i.e., home and boot
  mkdir /mnt/home /mnt/boot
  
  # mount boot and user data partitions
  mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/boot #ALERT: Don't use this command in UEFI mode of installation.
  mount /dev/sdb4 /mnt/home
  
  #FYI: To unmount you can use `umount pathToPartition` or `umount mountedDirectoryPath`
  
  ### Verify the mounted paths by
  lsblk
  ```
  
  9. Install archlinux to target partition using pacstrap, refer `pacstrap -h` for help on it. Installting archlinux, base packages and vim for now. We can include as many packages as we want from arch package repo here IMO. This command might take couple of minutes so BE PATIENT.
  ```
  pacstrap /mnt/ linux linux-firmware base vim
  ```
  
  FYI: With base we means this [package](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/any/base/), tldr; these packages: `bash, bzip2, coreutils, file, filesystem, findutils, gawk, gcc-libs, gettext, glibc, grep, gzip, iproute2, iputils, licenses, pacman, pciutils, procps-ng, psmisc, sed, shadow, systemd, systemd-sysvcompat, tar, util-linux, xz, linux (optional) - bare metal support`, I got this list from the dependencies section [here](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/any/base/).
  
  FYI: We don't need base-devel anymore. See [this](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=227602) issue and [this diff](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Installation_Guide&diff=253744&oldid=250715) in installation guide.
  
  10. Setting up auto mount all partitions to desired paths using file `/etc/fstab`. Recommendattion: Always use UUID's for making the entries coz they are not gonna change even if you plug-out and plug-in multiple hard drives later. We generate the fstab file using:
  ```
  # Print all the current mounted file systems
  genfstab -U /mnt
  
  # To write the same table to fstab file we do:
  genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
  
  #### Verif by checking the /mnt/etc/fstab file, edit the file according to your wish like you want some partitions to be mounted or not on boot time.
  ```
  
  11. Making archlinux bootable,
  ```
  arch-chroot /mnt
  # You get in a subshell now
  # FYI: You are logged in your newly installed system partition right now (before this we were in the usb os instance)
  # We verify that we are inside of newly installed system partitin by doing:
  cat /etc/fstab
  # This will output your fstab that you generated moments ago.
  ```
    - Now if we do `ls` then it'll show you your `home` folder ***here*** which you created at `/mnt/home` earlier.
    - Also, `lsblk` will show your _sdb3_ and _sdb4_ mounted at _/_ and _/home_.
  
  12. Installing packages
  ```
  pacman -S networkmanager
  
  # We want systemd to automatically start the networkmanager on startup, so we do it:
  systemctl enable NetworkManager
  ```
  
  13. (IGNORE THIS STEP COMPLETELY IF YOU ARE DOING UEFI though) _**UEFI > Legacy Boot**_  But if you are using Legacy Boot follow below code (else you can follow the later part where i install grub for uefi later in this post):
  ```
  grup-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda
  #YES PROBABLY ITS sda only (not sdb or sdc).
  # MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE CORRECT ^^^^^ device here(its sda here coz i am currently logged into my current system if you are following the tutorial in order.
  
  # Make config file for grub-
  grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
  ```
  14. Set password for root user-
  ```
  passwd
  # for ease set it to toor which is classical value of root user password
  ```
  15. Setting up locale (compulsory), you simply need to uncomment below two lines and save the file. i.e.,
  ```bash
  vim /etc/locale.gen
  en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
  en_US ISO-8859-1
  ```
  
  and generate the locals from `/etc/locale.gen` file using command:
  
  ```
  locale-gen
  ```
  
  16. Setting Language variable
  
  ```
  vim /etc/locale.conf
  # and enter below line and save the file
  LANG=en-US.UTF-8
  ```
  
  17. Setting up timzezone
  
  ```
  # List all the zone info details, and choose your country from below entries:
  ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/<TAB>
  
  # for India it should look like
  ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime
  ```
  
  18. Setting up hostname, (this is basically what it look in terminal i.e., `array@myHostName`.
  
  ```
  vim /etc/hostname
  # and type the hostname there, tip: use `arch-os` as hostname.
  ```
  
  19. Now you can get back to your usb archlinux environment back-
  
  ```
  exit
  ```
  
  20. Unmount all mounts we did earlier in `/mnt` directory-
  
  ```
  umount -R /mnt
  
  #If above command says: "Resource busy" then use below command instead, (-l is for lazy unmount option)-
  umount -l /mnt
  ```
  
  NOW REBOOT with `reboot` command and remove the USB and the system should boot from your newly installed system partition now. _**CONGRATS**_

  
# Post install processes
- Add a user to archlinux -
  ```
  useradd -m sahil
  
  # Set a password for user sahil
  passwd sahil
  
  # Add users to important groups so it can do things with sudo privilidges (you can apped lib-virt to the below list of groups if you want to use virtual machies with the user):
  usermod -aG wheel,audio,video,optical,storage sahil
  
  # TIP: You can use below command to delete a user
  userdel sahil
  ```

- If sudo is not installed, install it via
  ```
  pacman -S sudo
  ```
- Enabling sudo command for all wheel group users-
  ```
  visudo
  #And uncomment the line which looks like and save the file.
  %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
  ```
  
- **Installing GRUB for UEFI**-
  ```
  pacman -S grub
  pacman -S efibootmgr dosfstools os-prober mtools

  # Mount boot partition
  mkdir /boot/EFI
  mount /dev/sda1 /boot/EFI
  grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=grub-uefi --efi-directory=/boot/EFI
  #FYI: If grub-install says /boot/EFI is not efi partition:: then you need to change partition type{by `mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdb1`} and partition file system{by `fdisk /dev/sdb` and then using t<Enter>1<Enter>} of a partition only after unmounting the partition first , otherwise it won't actually work.
  ```
- Generate grub config file-
  ```
  grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
  ```
  
- Updating existing Archlinux
  
  ```
  pacman -Syu
  ```
  
- Test if you have internet after booting to your archlinux via:
  
  ```
  ping google.com
  ```
  
- Extra: Mounting ntfs pendrive
  ```
  sudo pacman -S ntfs-3g
  
  #Usage:
  sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdc1

  #Unmounting:
  sudo umount <pathToPartition/mountPath>
  #e.g, either of below should work:
  sudo umount /dev/sdc1
  sudo umount /mnt/sdc1
  #There is nothing like unmounting disk but partition ~ IMO ~SAHIL
  ```

- Know the filesystems of all your device partitions:
  
  ```
  df -T
  # and look for column "Type"
  ```
  
- Mimic windows formatted NTFS ? ~IMO~SAHIL
  ```
  disklabel               => DOS Partition Table
  partition type          => 07 -> HPFS/NTFS/exFAT
  filesystem of partition => fuseblk (you can do it somhow using mkfs though ~ SAHIL)
  ```

- Get uuid of all partitions:
  ```
  sudo blkid
  # Get UUID of a single partition:
  sudo blkid /dev/sdb1
  ```
- Enable network time synchronization:
  ```
  timedatectl set-ntp true
  ```
  
- Enable system-hardware synchronization:
  ```
  sudo hwclock --systohc
  ```
  
- Jumping to tty's
  ```
  ctrl+alt+F1 ....
  
  #IMPORTANT: To get back to i3wm
  ctrl+alt+F7
  ```

  ```
  
- Building packages from AUR in archlinux:
  ```
  # For help you can always do-
  makepkg -h
  
  makepkg -s <pkg_name>
  # -s means sync dependencies
  sudo pacman -U ./my-newly-made-package.tar.zst
  ```
  
- Installl `google-chrome`
  ```
  git clone google-chrome-from-AUR
  cd google-chrome
  makepkg -s
  sudo pacman -U google-chrome..tar.zst # You can omit this step if you use above command like ```makepkg -si```
  
  #FYI: -U option means install from a file/URL
  ```
  
- Add transparency ability to terminal by-
  
  ```
  sudo vim /etc/xdg/picom.conf
  # and set the value of vsync as false. By default it is set true in here.
  ```
  
- Add transparency to terminals
  ```
  #Keyboard
  exec setxkbmap ch &
  
  #Nitrogen
  exec nitrogen --restore
  
  #Picom (adds transparency ability to terminals)
  exec picom -f
  ```
  
- Setting i3 gaps to our i3. Find code [here](https://github.com/Airblader/i3/wiki/Example-Configuration) and add it to the end of `.config/i3/config` file. Now you can use `SUPER+SHIFT+g` and press `i` and then use `SHIFT++` or `SHIFT+-` to increase or decrease the inner gaps.

- `nmtui` to connect to wifi.

- Install i3
  ```
  sudo pacman -Syu
  sudo pacman -S i3
  
  # Tip: Double press <Enter> to configure i3 config file at the time of prompting for setting up usage.
  ```
  
  For setting i3status's language in i3bar, we need to add `LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8` as a line to `/etc/environment`.
  
  FYI: We must do above language setting otherwise it throws error like:
  ```
  ERROR: status command process exited unexpectedly (exit 1) in i3bar.
  ```
  
- Install more essentials (some gui and other utilities) 
  ```
  sudo pacman -S lightdm xfce-terminal lightdm-gtk-greeter lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings dmenu nitrogen xorg flameshot unzip
  
  # Also make use of
  lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings
  # to customize ui
  
  # Enable Display Manager lightdm service
  sudo systemctl enable lightdm
  
  # Now reboot to reflect the changes
  reboot
  
  # Set background at login/logout screen
  lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings
  
  
  
  # Get current resolution config of the monitor/s
  xrandr
  
  # Set resolution for a montitor
  xrandr -s 1920x1080
  
  # For setting resolution for second monitor
  xrandr --output MONITOR_NAME --mode DESIRED_RESOLUTION
  # example: (get MONITOR_NAME and DESIRED_RESOLUTION from xrandr command)
  xrandr --output DP-2-1 --mode 2560x1440
  ```
  
- Ram usage
  ```
  top
  
  # We can use htop as well, which is more powerful than top
  sudo pacman -S htop
  
  # Usage
  htop
  # Leverage htop ? 
  # Use ctrl+n/p to toggle between processes.
  # Use f4 to search in the processes list
  # Use k to send any signal, you get a list of signals which you can send.
  
  
  
  #### Check RAM and SWAP usage
  # Usage in gigabytes
  free -g
  
  # Usage in megabytes
  free -m 
  ```

- SWAP Partition test-
  
  ```
  # Confirm that fstab file has a swap partition entry
  cat /etc/fstab
  
  # Check if system shows SWAP usage
  free -m
  
  # Check below file shows swap usage
  cat /proc/swaps
  
  # Check if swapon shows swap usage with
  swapon
  swapon --show
  swapon -s
  # -s is to show summary 
  
  # Check swap usage with
  top
  htop
  ```
  
- Enabling hibernation: Tip: You must have SWAP partition setup before you can use hiberation feature.
  ```
  sudo vim /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
  
  # Find the line that says:
  HOOKS=(base udev autodetect modconf block filesystems keyboard fsk)
  # and add entity `resume` in between keyboard and fsk, so FINALLY it would look like
  HOOKS=(base udev autodetect modconf block filesystems keyboard resume fsck)
  
  ## Now edit another file
  sudo vim /etc/default/grub
  # and add the linux swap partition with UUID entry to the GRUB_CMDLINE_DEFAULT variable-
  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 quiet"
  # and add a resume paramter with UUID value of the SWAP partition (here 899efccc-3a01-48bb-aa44-1de74cc9798a is UUID of my SWAP atm of installation)
  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 resume=UUID=899efccc-3a01-48bb-aa44-1de74cc9798a quiet"
  
  # FINISHED!
  # tldr;
  # You need to ensure that you have a swap partition and have a the corresponding entry for it in /etc/fstab file.
  # Entry in /etc/fstab file ensures that swapon is run for the swap_partition/swap_file at the system startup.
  ```

  sudo pacman -S alsa-utils pulseaudio
  alsactl init
  ```
  
  **UPDATE: LEARN: Pulseaudio can be pain in ass at times, and this comes as like pulseaudio user config files can get corrupted at times. So to fix that you can fix that via:**
  
  ```bash
  rm -rf ~/.pulse ~/.config/pulse
  
  # restart pulseaudio now (things should be FIXED BY THIS!!), src: https://askubuntu.com/a/536488/702911, src: https://appuals.com/how-to-fix-pulseaudio-issues-in-linux/
  pulseaudio -k

- Pacman
  
  ```
  # Search for below options via
  man pacman
  # to get detailed and concise details of how a option works internally
  # -S : sync libraries from remote repository of arch
  # -y : the means referesh the packagedatabase from server.
  # -u : Restrict or filter output to packages that are out-of-date on the local system. Only package version are used to find outdated packages; replacements are not checked here. This optin works best when used iwth `-Sy` option. (FROM `man pacman`)

  # Update a specific package
  sudo pacman -S pkg-name
  
  # Search among installed packages
  pacman -Qs pkg-name
  
  # Search on available packages frmo archlinux packages repo
  pacman -Ss pkg-name
  # FYI: -S means sync, -s means search.
  ```
  
- What shell are you using ?
  ```
  echo $SHELL
  # default output would be
  /bin/bash
  ```
  
- Install more utility AUR PACKAGES

- Setting up bluetooth in arch-
  ```
  sudo pacman -S blueman
  # now this package installed config file as well-
  sudo vim /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
  
  # Start the service and enable service to run on startup-
  sudo systemctl start bluetooth
  sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
  
  # Verify
  sudo systemctl status bluetooth
  
  # Enable bluetooth device on startup-
  sudo vim /etc/bluetooth/main.conf

  ```
  
  and now use
  
  ```
  # Install bluez-utils
  sudo pacman -S bluez-utils
  # now we have bluetoothctl cli tool
  
  blc
  # alias for `bluetoothctl`
  # opens a subshell
  
  power on
  # turns on the bluetooth device
  
  default-agent
  # enables auto connection with devices after you connect once with a device
  
  scan on
  # not it'll output all the available devices it finds nearby
  
  trust <mac_id>
  # you can type just two letters starting of any visible devices and use <TAB> to autocomplete the address.
  
  pair <mac_id>
  
  # You can see your paired devices using
  devices
  
  # connect to your device
  connect <mac_id>
  ```
  
- Connecting a bluetooth headset/speaker
  ***Prerequisite: You must have already installed `pulseaudio` in your system.***
  
  ```
  sudo pacman -S pulseaudio-bluetooth
  
  sudo vim /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
  # and edit the line which says
  ControllerMode = dual
  # and finally it should look like 
  ControllerMode = bredr
  # now logout and login so that pulseaudio-bluetooth can take this change into effect.
  
  # Now we can use bluetoothctl to simply connect your headset/portable speaker.
  ```
  
- Notifications in archlinux
  ```
  sudo pacman -S notify-osd
  
  #THIS IS OPTIONAL IMO ( and I don't know what exactly it does though)
  sudo pacman -S libnotify
  
  # Install dunst
  sudo pacman -S dunst
  mkdir -p ~/.config/dunst
  
  # copy config file to user defined config file location-
  cp /etc/dunst/dunstrc ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
  ```
  
- Now we need to reboot the system coz sending a notification with command-
  ```
  # Send a sample notification
  notify-send --icon=gtk-info "TitleHere" "DescriptionHere"
  
  # NOTE: You only need to have double quotes if any of your title or description has spaces in its text.
  # ALSO: ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO `~/.config/dunst/dunstrc` file won't take effect until you run -
  killall dunst
  # WARNING: You might not be able to see the dunst binary's vi effect taken into account by notify-send, so to fix that you must logout-login once (or do a reboot).  
  ```
  
- Battery info
  
  ```
  sudo pacman -S acpi
  acpi -b
  # This tells us if battery is charing/discharing, % of battery left, estimated time for what pc can run until dying.
  
  #Sample outputs
  Battery 0: Charging, 99%, 00:01:00 until charged
  Battery 0: Discharging, 99%, 02:41:11 remaining
  ```
  
- Pushing sound alert and visible notification on full battery and low battery events. Refer @ https://github.com/sahilrajput03/config/blob/main/scripts-in-use/battery-status.sh .
 
  
- See how many cores you have in your cpu
  ```
  nproc
  ```
  
- Enable parallel compiling in arch
  
  ```
  sudo nano /etc/makepkg.conf
  # search for line
  MAKEFLAGS="-j2"
  # this means to use 2 threads i.e., use two cores of cpu to run the compilation phase whenever we use makepkg command, so instead we can do it like:
  MAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc)"
  ```
  
- What is makepkg ?
  
  You can read a file named PKGBUILD, you'll find this file in any source code of a program from AUR website. So you would read the variable meanings of this file content @ https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD .
  
- Arch programs
  
  - Arch packages: archlinux.org/packages
  - Arch User Repository: aur.archlinux.org
  
  Tip: You can simply install any package from Arch Packages by
  ```
  sudo pacman -S pkg-name
  ```
  
  Tip2: You would need to do
  ```
  git clone any_AUR_program_url
  cd program-name
  makepkg -si
  ```

  
```
  sudo pacman -R pulseaudio pulseaudio-bluetooth noisetorch pulseaudio-alsa
```
