# To push new quotes

Please add quotes directly to the `thouhts.md` file in `src` directory.

# (DEPRECATED NOTE) How to publish new thoughts?

_Note to developer: Please do not edit the `dist/thoughts.md` file because its automatically generated at build time and will be completely overwritten on new build._

Whenever you update anything in `thoughts-principles-react` directory the `.github/workflows/npm-build.yml` workflow file is triggered. Thus whenever you update the `thoughts-principles-react/public/thoughts.md` file the build is autogenerated and commited to github repo. This will lead to one final github workflow to trigger i.e, `pages build and deployment` which will use the lastest build files in the `dist` directory. That's all. Thanks to Github Actions and AI to help me through this.

# Thoughts And Principles

You can write markdown + html in file `thoughts.md`.

Currently I'm splitting the whole file with `\n\n` i.e., two new line characters to get markdown and then parse that markdown.

I am rendering each block of text as markdown via `react-markdown` library. Source: [remarkjs/react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)

In this markdown rendering, I added two plugins:

- `rehype-raw`: This plugin helps to render html contained in markdown.
  - Officially recommended by `react-markdown` [here](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#appendix-a-html-in-markdown).
  - Plugin Github: [rehypejs/rehype-raw](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw)
- `rehype-external-links`: This plugin helps to manipulate markdown links AS WELL AS achor tags `<a>` present in html present in markdown.

  - I am using this plugin so that my markdown links are updated with `target="_blank"`
  - Officially recommended by `react-markdown` [here](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown/blob/main/changelog.md#900---2023-09-27).
  - Plugin Github: [rehypejs/rehype-external-links](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-external-links)

  Thanks.
