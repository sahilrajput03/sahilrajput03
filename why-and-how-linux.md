Q. Open source softwares have steep learning curve and are less user friendly! Is it?

This is a biased opinon becoz of the less advertisement, awareness of opensource softwares. Actually its not true for every software.. like i used to think like that coz i had no experience with quality and simplicity of opensource softwares before.
But its not always the case( almost always):
see
- **vlc:** (oss)
- **Chromium:** (oss, 1. which is original product as chrome white-lables and rebrand it on every release as chrome funds it and leverage the oss, 2. without chrome secretly collecting data)
- **inkscape:** which is a direct competetor to adobe vector graphics (i was amazed on the simplicity and usage of this particular when i used it over time)
- **7zip tool:** (winrar was always wanted me to buy it, but 7zip is free and felt freedom)
- **keepass:** an amazing password storing vault which i use for almost 10+ years (this is REAL GOOD THING - everyone should use it, i backup my keepass_database i guess once a while on github repo to use in case my laptop is stolen).
- **virtual box:** which almost every company uses for virtual machies for its simplicity and  amazingnes(i prefre another linux-only solution i.e, kvm which is also pretty neat).

**Conclusion:**

- Its better to learn using the oss rather then getting hacked with crack softwares.
