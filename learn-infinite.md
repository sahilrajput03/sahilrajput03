# Learn Infinite

So, what is this by the way?

**Making coding tutorials with [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/).**

I can create coding tutorials and update the code in it with code. For e.g., I can make a course that I can update anytime and the example code shown in the video can show use the updated version of the tutorial because its all just code.

Tradeoffs:
- Never host on youtube because the content would be timeless as it will be updated anytime in future and with youtube.

Pros:
- I can update my coding tutorial and make the guided video with 100% upgradability in future, thus newer syntax and best practise updates can be made with time.
- I can keep the video pause experience amazing because the background audio keep playing all the time even when the video is paused. The background audio can keep playing.
