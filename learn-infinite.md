# Learn Infinite

So, what is this by the way?

I can create coding tutorials and update the code in it with code. For e.g., I can make a course that I can update anytime and the example code used shown in the video is simply as update of the code.

Tradeoffs:
- Never host on youtube because the content would be timeless as it will be updated anytime in future and with youtube.

Pros:
- I can update my coding tutorial and make the guided path to learn anything very optimal.
