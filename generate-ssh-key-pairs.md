## Generating ssh key pairs

- Learn: A **public key is always contained inside the private key**, you can get that public key using openssl anytime.
  - Extract public key (ssh public key) from private key file using `openssl`: [Click here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5246045/10012446)
- Read how private-public [keys work together here](https://www.devco.net/archives/2006/02/13/public_-_private_key_encryption_using_openssl.php).

```bash
# Simple ssh keys generation:
ssh-keygen

# Specify file name `myfile.ppk` and `myfile.ppk.pub`, these files are private key and public key respectively.
ssh-keygen -f myfile.ppk

# Using Ed25519 Algorithm (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, 255-bit key) which is smaller, faster, equally or more secure over RSA. (Inspiration: Github Docs)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Note: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:
#   Also, `-t rsa` ‚Üí specifies the algorithm type (RSA) AND `-b 4096` ‚Üí sets the key length to 4096 bits (stronger than the older default of 2048 and still considered secure for most uses today)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

**Check default algoright used by `ssh-keygen`:**

- On a modern system, you‚Äôll get:
  - Algorithm: Ed25519
  - Files: myfile (private), myfile.pub (public)
- On an older system, you‚Äôll get:
  - Algorithm: RSA (2048-bit by default unless you set -b)

We produce a dummy key file and check its fingerprint to find the default algorigthm used:

```sh
# Check default algorith of your ssl
ssh-keygen -f /tmp/testkey -N ""

# Get fingerprint from file, it can be either private or public key file as both produce same output. (TESTED)
ssh-keygen -lf /tmp/testkey
# Output: 256 SHA256:7tV10WEIK9OrPYsUtSlAJIqf4y4bdsmORnAfzgKyRCM apple@apples-MacBook-Pro.local (ED25519)
```

From the fingerprint (output of above command), we see that **`ED25519` is the default algorithm used by `ssh-keygen` on my macbook. (6 Sept 2025)**

## ‚ù§Ô∏è What does the confirm fingerprint message mean when we connect for the first time to a server?

When we connect to a server via ssh for the first time we see following message 

```bash
ssh someuser@somehost
# ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:XNMy8ZTv+eT21BKsGqSGqgLbSD1WG0hiUHbANX5Y2yY. üëà
# This key is not known by any other names.
# Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
# Warning: Permanently added '172.105.61.99' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
# Last login: Sun May  4 11:10:09 2025 from 49.156.78.200
# [root@localhost ~]# 
```

‚ù§Ô∏èLearn: `"This key is not known by any other names":` in above message **means that the SSH client does not recognize the server's key because it is not present in your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file. This file stores the fingerprints of servers you have connected to before, allowing SSH to verify the server's identity in future connections.**

**‚ù§Ô∏èWhy This Happens:**
1. This message appears when you are connecting to a server for the first time, or if the server's host key has changed.
2. It is a security measure to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could impersonate the server.

**What You Should Do:**
1. Verify the Fingerprint: Confirm that the fingerprint matches the one provided by the server administrator. This ensures you are connecting to the correct server.
2. Add the Key to Known Hosts: If the fingerprint is correct, you can add it to your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file by typing yes when prompted. This will store the key for future connections.
3. Bypass the Prompt (Optional): If you are sure about the server's authenticity and want to bypass the prompt, you can use the `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` option in your SSH command - `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@hostname` However, this is not recommended for regular use, as it skips the verification step.

**To view the SSH host key fingerprint on the remote machine and confirm it **matches ‚úÖ** the one shown during your SSH connection, you can run below command:**

```bash
#   -l: Show the fingerprint.
#   -f: Specify the file path of the public key.
#   `ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`: This is the default location of the ED25519 host key.
ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
# Output:
# 256 SHA256:XNMy8ZTv+eT21BKsGqSGqgLbSD1WG0hiUHbANX5Y2yY root@localhost (ED25519) üëà
```

**Note:** If your remote server uses a different key type (e.g., RSA or ECDSA), replace ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub with the appropriate file: `ssh_host_rsa_key.pub` (for RSA) and `ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub` (for ECDSA).
