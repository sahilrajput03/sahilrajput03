Discipline means choosing between what you want now and what you want most. ~ Unkonwn

Curiosità is defined by Micheal J. Geib and Leonardo as “an insatiable curious approach to life and an unrelenting quest for continuous learning.” Nature of mind is to wander around, its not problem its the way its designed. My job is to keep getting it back towards the goal.

**Its true that we save salts with the passwords in the database as well i.e., the starting of the password is just the salt used only:**

```js
let bc = require('bcryptjs')
let saltRounds = 14 // The higher the saltRounds value, the more time the hashing algorithm takes. 
// Note equal time is taken to verify as well i.e, when we call `compareSync` funciton.
let salt = bc.genSaltSync(saltRounds) // DEFAULT VALUE for salt is 10

console.log('SALT:', salt)

let hash = bc.hashSync('car', salt)
console.log('HASH:', hash)

// Verify
console.log(bc.compareSync('car', hash)) // true

// SAMPLE OUTPUTS:
// SALT: $2a$10$HKfmu6IQUO4B9b/8LcdrVu
// HASH: $2a$10$HKfmu6IQUO4B9b/8LcdrVu9YsuALxHTA0GBUvyj4b2Ia/nB5JlKgm

// SALT: $2a$10$1FIlrxjpmaypBpSKGkScPO
// HASH: $2a$10$1FIlrxjpmaypBpSKGkScPOUFP9HgmFHoDOk.rIK8D.OGX6CoBV2U6

## Do changing dns makes you anonymoust?

Source: [Click here](https://qr.ae/pvekBP)

Here’s a short summary of how DNS works:

Using your ISP’s DNS

In your browser, you type AustinBike.com - Home

Your browser asks your ISP for AustinBike.com - Home

Your ISP uses its DNS server to figure out that the website is at 74.208.236.250

Your ISP goes to 74.208.236.250, gets the page and sends it to your browser.

Using a third party DNS

In your browser, you type AustinBike.com - Home

Your browser asks the third party for the address of AustinBike.com - Home

The third party uses its DNS server to figure out that the website is at 74.208.236.250

The third party tells your browser to ask for 74.208.236.250 which is sent to your ISP.

Your ISP goes to 74.208.236.250, gets the page and sends it to your browser.

(Yeah, I’ve simplified this for the non-tech people, this is not EXACTLY how it works.)

But notice that the last statement for both is exactly the same. This is because everything on the internet is transported via IP addresses. And ISPs store IP addresses, not domain names. If law enforcement ever came knocking on your ISPs door asking what you were up to, they’d hand them a list of IP addresses that your computer asked for, not domains. LE will have tools to do the lookups and complete the list with “human readable” domain names.

If you had a VPN, all of the traffic that you ISP would have would look like this:

Outbound requests: You to VPN

Inbound requests: VPN to You

BUT if law enforcement wanted to know what you were up to, they would go to your VPN provider. If they cooperated the list would be exactly like the list your ISP would hand over above. Some VPN companies do not log requests, some do. If they are not logging they would tell LE that they have nothing to turn over.

Don’t just assume that because you are using a VPN that your traffic is hidden. All you have done is put one more hurdle into the process, not stopped it. A VPN also has to not log the data. Some may say they don’t but could be secretly logging it. You cannot ever be 100% sure that you are safe just because you are using a VPN.

Additionally, if LE really, really wanted to know what you are doing, they could put taps on line at the VPN provider to figure things out without needing their logs. But you’d need to be a pretty bad guy for that, not someone just searching for porn or other questionable content.

## making insecure requests with `postman` or `curl`

**Case Scenario:** Say you are running a flask server via:

```bash
flask run --cert=adhoc --host=0.0.0.0
```

so when if try to request from a curl or postman you wont' see any response bcoz both of these ([curl](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24618403/10012446) / [postman](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45009840/10012446)) are not enabled for secure requests.

For curl you can make use ok `-k` option: 

```bash
curl -k https://mynotifyservice.ddns.net:5000/
```

## unsigned means?

`Dictionary - unsigned` : not having a plus or minus sign, or a bit representing this.

Unsigned Integers (often called "uints") are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don't have a + or - sign associated with them. Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive). We use uint's when we know the value we are counting will always be non-negative.

## Execute code on tab close

```js
window.addEventListener("beforeunload", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.returnValue = ""; // this value has to be other than null and undefined.
});

// for react, use reference: https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-handle-tab-close-event
// amazing blogger: https://bobbyhadz.com/
```

So when you try to close tab, browser will ask once again like that -

## Thats how colors work in nodejs

FYI; In node repl mode, [src](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/how-to-use-util-inspect/).

> Finally, the optional argument colorize is a boolean that adds ANSI escape codes to the string output. When logged to a terminal window, it should be pretty printed with colors. ~ Same above source page of nodejs docs.

## Calling one express route from another route

Source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/38948889/10012446

I added answer to that question as well, here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/73001807/10012446

Hilarious and Feels stupid to think of this though now.

```js
// @ts-nocheck
const app = require('express')()
const axios = require('axios')
const log = console.log

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
	res.json('yoy')
})

const listener = app.listen(async () => {
	const url = 'http://localhost:' + listener.address().port // IF you are using static port value you do not need `listener.address().port` and simply provide that port value here instead.
	log({url})

	let response = await axios.get(url)
	log('GOT DATA IN RESPONSE:', response.data) // yoy
})
```

If you are using it general case i.e., STATIC PORT value, you can do it like:

```js
// @ts-nocheck
const app = require('express')()
const axios = require('axios')
const log = console.log

const PORT = 3000
const URL = 'http://localhost:' + PORT
const apiPath = (path) => URL + path

app.get('/a', (req, res) => {
	res.json('yoy')
})

app.listen(PORT, async () => {
	let response = await axios.get(apiPath('/a'))
	log('RESPONSE DATA:', response.data)
})
```

## Arranging date named objects in alphabetical order?

A good exerpt on that problem.

> Save the migration code in the file migrations/20211209_00_initialize_notes_and_users.js. Migration file names should always be named alphabetically when created so that previous changes are always before newer changes. One good way to achieve this order is to start the migration file name with the date and a sequence number.

## Did you know "We can get the number of parameters defined in its function definition ?

```js
((a) => {}).length // 1
((a, b) => {}).length // 2
((a, b, c) => {}).length //3
```

Expressjs uses this to identify if the callback you specified has two or three OR four params in its definition and based on that it judges if the middles should be treated as a errorHandler or simple middleware. Yikes!

https://javascript.info/promisify

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/node-js-util-promisify-method

https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utilpromisifyoriginal

https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#filehandlereadfileoptions

In `nodejs`: We have `util.promisify` buitin method basically takes a function as an input that follows the common Node.js callback style, i.e., with a (err, value) and returns a version of the same that returns a promise instead of a callback.



```js
import { readFile } from 'node:fs';


let callback =  (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
}

// Callback Usage:
readFile('/etc/passwd', callback); // OR 
readFile('/etc/passwd', 'utf8', callback);

// Making use of util.promisify
const util = require('node:util');

// Reading the file using a promise & printing its text
const readFileSync = util.promisify(fs.readFile);
readFileSync('./promisify.js', 'utf8') // Reading the same file
   .then((text) => {
      console.log(text);
   })
// Printing error if any
   .catch((err) => {
      console.log('Error', err);
});
```

cd flash && npm link
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/sahilrajput03/learning-monogo-and-mongoosejs
cd learning-monogo-and-mongoosejs/mongoosejs-with-hot-flash
npm i && npm link flash

## Why and how I love and hate `jest` ?

Love: Bcoz its assertion i.e., [expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect) and [expect's docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect) is open source. So this allows me to use their assertions in my own test runner library. Yikes!

I.e.,

```bash
npm i expect
```

```js
const {expect} = require('expect')
expect('1').toBe('2') // throws error just like jest does!
````

Hate: Jest's test runner has no capability to share values and module between tests suites in watch mode. [Issue closed here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/6800). But it seems that work is going on this [issue here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/7184).

## Git submodules

Adding a github submodule

```bash
git submodule add "github_url" directory_path
```

### How to **fix** submodule shit..?

Problem: If you accidentally did a `git add .` in any of your github repo where you had some nested repository, then git automatically adds that repository as a submodule to your
existing (parent repository) and then you don't get a live link in your github repo page.

**How to FIX**

Simply move your nested git repo elsewhere and do a commit to clean it for a while, and then move back the nestedGitRepo back to where it was and add it in proper way, followed by
git commit. It looks like that:

```bash
mv someNestedGitRepo ../
git add . && git commit -m "Remove submodule."
# Now, move back the nestedGitRepo back to current repo and add it in proper way!
mv ../someNestedRepo .
git submodule add "github_url" directory_path
# Now, you get to commit, and its done!
git add . && git commit -m Fix submodule.
```

### Sources for git submodules

- git submodules: https://www.catalyst.net.nz/blog/git-submodule-misunderstood-beast-or-remorseless-slavering-monster

### To clone a git repo with all its nested submodules 🚴︎ 🚴︎

# gclWithSubmodules is aliased to `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8'

## vertical and horizontal pod scaling, what kind of constratins to consider?

```txt
# usefule text from: https://devopswithkubernetes.com/part-3/3-gke-features
# Scaling
Scaling can be either horizontal scaling or vertical scaling. Vertical scaling is the act of increasing resources available to a pod or a node. Horizontal scaling is what we most often mean when talking about scaling, increasing the number of pods or nodes. We'll focus on horizontal scaling.

There are multiple reasons for wanting to scale an application. The most common reason is that the number of requests an application receives exceeds the number of requests that can be processed. Limitations are often either the amount of requests that a framework is intended to handle or the actual CPU or RAM.

Figuring out autoscaling with HorizontalPodAutoscalers can be one of the more challening tasks. Choosing which resources to look at and when to scale is not easy. In our case, we only stress the CPU. But your applications may need to scale based on, and take into consideration, a number of resources e.g. network, disk or memory.

# Output:
# Usage: env [OPTION]... [-] [NAME=VALUE]... [COMMAND [ARG]...]
# Set each NAME to VALUE in the environment and run COMMAND.
# 
# Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
#   -i, --ignore-environment  start with an empty environment
#   -0, --null           end each output line with NUL, not newline
#   -u, --unset=NAME     remove variable from the environment
#   -C, --chdir=DIR      change working directory to DIR
#   -S, --split-string=S  process and split S into separate arguments;
#                         used to pass multiple arguments on shebang lines
#       --block-signal[=SIG]    block delivery of SIG signal(s) to COMMAND
#       --default-signal[=SIG]  reset handling of SIG signal(s) to the default
#       --ignore-signal[=SIG]   set handling of SIG signal(s) to do nothing
#       --list-signal-handling  list non default signal handling to stderr
#   -v, --debug          print verbose information for each processing step
#       --help     display this help and exit
#       --version  output version information and exit
# 
# A mere - implies -i.  If no COMMAND, print the resulting environment.

## bus factor

*[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)*

The bus factor is a measurement of the risk resulting from information and capabilities not being shared among team members, derived from the phrase "in case they get hit by a bus". It is also known as the bus problem, lottery factor, truck factor,[1] bus/truck number, or lorry factor. 

**In a sentence** (from devopsiwthkubernetes): *If your files don't tell Kubernetes and your team what the state should be and instead you run commands that edit the state you are just lowering the bus factor for your cluster and application.*

## things i kept doing doing..

I have a habit of looking for the **_best of best_** of the articles, courses, blogs, books, materials that I feel sometimes is a time taking process and I don't follow or kind of forget like the official way of doing things me or anybody else must be doing, i.e., follow official documentation of softwares, libraries, tools, standards, ie., OFFICIAL documentation. One big mistake: "Not able to find the real production ready free template of coreui in previous job is this only".

## using `auto-changelog`

Source: https://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-changelog

Sample generated: [Click here](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-react-admin-template/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

Sample (this repository): [Click here](CHANGELOG.md)

Tip: You can use custom template as [shown here](https://github.com/cookpete/auto-changelog#custom-templates) in docs.

Add below to your `package.json` file and run `npm run changelog` to generate a `CHANGELOG.md` file. It simply generates list of all commit to the target file simply date wise.

```json
    "changelog": "auto-changelog -p --commit-limit false"
```

FYI (using -p is important else you won't get commits in your `CHANGELOG.md` file): `-p, --package # use version from package.json as latest release`

FYI: If you plan to execute it on npm version script, then you do it like (official docs of auto-changelog):

```json
  "scripts": {
    "version": "auto-changelog -p && git add CHANGELOG.md"
  }
```

**_HENCE, whenever you run `npm version patch/minor/major`, your `version` script will be run as well. YO_**

## monkey*patching ( or \_hot fixes*) ?

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch

A monkey patch is a way for a program to extend or modify supporting system software locally (affecting only the running instance of the program).

_Etymology_

The term monkey patch seems to have come from an earlier term, guerrilla patch, which referred to changing code sneakily – and possibly incompatibly with other such patches – at runtime. The word guerrilla, homophonous with gorilla (or nearly so), became monkey, possibly to make the patch sound less intimidating.[1]

An alternative etymology is that it refers to “monkeying about” with the code (messing with it).

Despite the name's suggestion, the "monkey patch" is sometimes the official method of extending a program. For example, web browsers such as Firefox and Internet Explorer used to encourage this, although modern browsers (including Firefox) now have an official extensions system.

## Declarative vs. imperative

REMEMBERING SHORTFORM: **HI** (**h**ow->**i**mperative), so declarative must a **what**.

```
WORD MEANINGS:
==============
imperative (dictionary):
1. of vital importance; crucial. E.g., "immediate action was imperative"
2. giving an authoritative command; peremptory.

declarative
1. of the nature of or making a declaration.
"declarative statements"
2. (COMPUTING)
denoting high-level programming languages which can be used to solve problems without requiring the programmer to specify an exact procedure to be followed.

```

**Imperative(HOW)**: In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing ***how*** a program operates. The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying all the details of how the program should achieve the result. ***Exampe of imperative programming, is like we defined algorithms in explicit steps. ~Sahil***

**Declarative (WHAT)**: In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing ***what*** the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describe how to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives (the how being left up to the language's implementation). ***This is in contrast with imperative programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps.***

## expressions are `awiated`

```
let a = async () => ({data: "cool"})
console.log(await a().data) // Output: <nothing>
// The reason it doesn't work bcoz we're trying to await the data property of the promise returned by `a()`.

console.log((await a()).data) // Output: 'cool'
// works good enough!
```

## `for await` syntax in js

```js
for await (const i of [Promise.resolve(10), Promise.resolve(20), Promise.resolve(30)]){
    console.log(await i)
}
# Output:

# NOTICE: The - and + signs represents changes while going from source to target i.e., file a to file b.







$ git log --oneline
# Output:
commit5 (HEAD -> main) Add file3.txt
commit4 Add express
commit3 Add react.
commit2 Npm init the project.
commit1 Add two files.
# FYI:
commit0=4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904 # THIS LINE IS NOT SHOWN BUT IS ALWAYS COMMIT0. This is useful when you want to see diff from origin or repo.
# You can set empty variable in bash so that you can reference 0th commit easily.



######## DIFF SYNTAX ########
git diff sourceCommit [targetCommit=HEAD]


# GIT EXAMPLE 0:
git diff commit4
# Shows changed made AFTER commit4 state.
# this can be done otherwise
git diff commit4 commmit5


# GIT EXAMPLE 1:
git diff commitId1 commitId2
# FYI: The - and + signs represents changes while going from source(commitId1) to target(commitId2) i.e., file `a` to file `b`.
# FYI: To see the chronological changes(i.e, + and - signs with respect to real time) you must use the source commitID as commit that you made before target commitId.


# GIT EXAMPLE 2:
# Get the detais of any commmit it'll show you the diff from /dev/null state to the final states of all the files after making the commit.
git show COMMIT_3 # Same as below
git diff commit2 COMMIT_3


# GIT EXAMPLE 3:
git show commit1
# FYI: This shows all the details of that commit, like time/date, author and the diff with source as state before the commit and target as state after the commit.

# GIT EXAMPLE 4:
# What does below command do? (LEAST USEFUL, unless you want to use `git diff HEAD` to view the diff for currently staged changes)
git diff commit3
# Ans: It shows all the changes made after `commit3` to the current staged area or the last commit state.

# GIT EXAMPLE 5:
# FUN FACT: If you use
git diff <lastCommit>
# OR
git diff HEAD
# You will see diff only if you have changes in staged area. (i.e., you changed something and did ```git add .```


# GIT EXAMPLE 6:
# NOTICE IF YOU WANT TO SEE DIFF FROM EMPTY COMMIT(source commit) TO A PARTICULAR COMMIT (target commit), you would need use something like:
# First we need to define the empty commit id (which is same for all git repositories), then we can use ```git diff```: Source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/25064285/10012446
empty=4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
git diff $empty commit3

# GIT EXAMPLE 6a (COPY OF 6):
#### FUN FACT : FOR THE FIRST COMMIT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE SAME (bcoz there were no changes before that commit) BY:
git diff $empty commit1
# would output same result as below command:
git show commit1

## Difference between `git reset --hard` and `git revert <shaHere>`

tl;dr: There is a very great significance of using `revert` instead of `git reset` coz it preserver all history and its important if you pushed earlier commmit to puclic and want it to be undone(remove) and still don't want to force push then `git revert` rocks coz it does exactly that! Read below like for more insights!.

Source: [Here](https://github.blog/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/#undo-a-public-change).

## Get back to previous commit but keep the directory as it is (i.e., only change the commit history and keep the source code as it is)

The key point is that you don't do

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD^
# rather you should do below >>>
git reset HEAD^
# And now your source code is AS IT IS but the last commit is removed from the history.
```

## Set github remote url directly without removing origin url

```bash

git remote set-url origin1 <urlHere>
# Output: error: No such remote 'origin1'

## Learning file descriptions, stdin(0), stdoutput(1) and stderr(2) ?

| File Descriptor | Abbreviation | Description     |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| 0               | STDIN        | Standard Input  |
| 1               | STDOUT       | Standard Output |
| 2               | STDERR       | Standard Error  |

Example 1:

```bash
#Note: We can replace > with 1> as well and it behaves exactly same.

echo I am sahil 2> output1          # One file is created.
cat output1
# Output: --no-output



echo I am sahil > output1             #  One file is created.
cat output1
# Output: I am sahil



echo I am sahil > ouput1 > ouput2     # Two files are created.
cat output1
# Ouput: --no-ouput
cat output2
# Output: I am sahil




echo I am sahil > output1 > output2 2> output3      # Three files are created.
ls
# Output: output1  output2  output3
cat output1 # No contents.
cat output2
# Output: I am sahil
cat output3 # No contents.




echo I am sahil 2> output1 > output2 > output3        # Three files are created.
ls
# Output: output1  output2  output3
cat output1 # No contents.
cat output2 # No contents.
cat output3
# Output: I am sahil
```

Example 2:

````bash
wc doesntexist.txt > output                   # Output: ```cat ouput``` prints nothing.
wc doesntexist.txt 2> output                  # Output: ```cat ouput``` prints ```wc: does: No such file or directory```

wc doesntexist.txt > /dev/null | grep ""      # Ouput: grep prints the error i.e., stderr is passed via pipe to grep.
wc doesntexist.txt 2> /dev/null | grep ""     # Ouput: grep DOESN'T prints the error i.e., stderr is passed to /dev/null and not passed via pipe to grep.

wc doesntexist 2> /dev/stdout | grep ""       # Output: grep prints the error, i.e., stderr is passed to stdout then stdout is passed via pipe to grep.
wc doesntexist 2> /dev/stderr | grep ""       # Output: grep prints the error, i.e., we redirect stderr to stderr then stderr is passed via pipe to grep.

# LEARNING: Both stdout and stderr are passed via pipe and grep gets both of those.
````

## Pipe stderr via without forwarding standard ouput

```
command 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep 'something'

# A more verbose manner to do that as stated in first comment of the SO's answer @ https://stackoverflow.com/a/2342841/10012446
command 2> /dev/stdout 1> /dev/null | grep 'something'
```

So, How to redirect STDERR to STDOUT in Linux ??
Answer: The command to do that is `2>&1`. [Source](https://www.middlewareinventory.com/blog/linux-stdout-stderr-bash/).

## Commited _node_modules_ to your repository along with the **some new and modified files** accidentally ?

The solution is recommended when you can manage to put all the commits after the node*modules added to the repository to be squashed to a single commit because its a very \_naive* solution of my own to remove `node_modules` from the git history.

**Remove `node_modules` from the most recent commit only via `--amend` method:**

```bash
# You can literally copy paste below commands to fix the shit.
git rm --cached -r .                          # Reset the tracking area.
echo node_modules >> .gitignore
git add . && git commit --amend --no-edit      # Amend last commit as it is(but with node_modules ``git ignored``)!
```

**Another way if are in situation where lots of commits are made since you added `node_modules` to the repository (i.e., BLUNDER HELL ehh..) via:**

````bash
git branch temp                   # Make a backup branch of current branch's status.
git reset --hard HEAD             # Get to the desired/last commit where you didn't have node_modules.
git merge --no-ff temp            # Merge without making a commit.
git rm --cached -r .              # Now remove everything(_node_modules_) coz ```git merge --no-ff``` re-added everything to the the staging area.
echo node_modules >> .gitignore
git add . && git commit -m 'My new commit without node_modules.'
````

## Promise based apis of `fs` in Node.js..

Source, firt seen in remix's code by Ryan Florence [here](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/blog).

Look [here for docs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promise-example).

i.e.,

```js
import {unlink, readFile} from 'fs/promises'

try {
	await unlink('/tmp/hello') // unlink is used to delte a file.
	console.log('successfully deleted /tmp/hello')
} catch (error) {
	console.error('there was an error:', error.message)
}

// ~sahill: for reading file
const file = await readFile(filepath)
```

## Frontmatter ?

**And.** Its reffered to **yaml code in the start of blog post file**. Popularized by jekyll in first. Read about [Front matter at Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).

For converting yaml to js object you can use [`front-matter`](https://github.com/jxson/front-matter) package from npm and thats awesome. Atleast _Ryan Florence_ uses this in his remix's quick start guide. So it must be good! 💯 And this front-matter does whats its description says **Extract YAML front matter from strings** in the github repo.

Why use `front-matter` package which is not much popular and simply use some other yaml to js-object/json converter package from npm ?

**Ans.** Bcoz when we need to read file such as blog post we know that its just first few lines between === or --- or some pattern like that made by different blog post frameworks (e.g., jekyll and gatsby). **_So if we use front-matter then it manages and deals with yaml + non yaml(i.e. content of blog-post) on its own. So this way using a library like front-matter rocks! 💯_**

## Yaml curiosity ?

**FYI: Yaml to json converter**:  [onlineyamltools.com](https://www.convertjson.com/yaml-to-json.htm)

Example:

```yaml
indian:
  - 1
  - 2 > 3
  - '2'
  - true
  - 'true'
  - truthy
  - null
  - 'null'
  - cost: 5
  - otherPeople:
    rohit: 10
    admins:
      aman: 10
      alergy:
      - dust
      - particles
india: 10
```

converts to:

```json
{
  "indian": [
    1,
    "2 > 3",
    "2",
    true,
    "true",
    "truthy",
    null,
    "null",
    {
      "cost": 5
    },
    {
      "otherPeople": null,
      "rohit": 10,
      "admins": {
        "aman": 10,
        "alergy": [
          "dust",
          "particles"
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "india": 10
}
```

[yaml.org](https://yaml.org/) - Yaml official site.

Q. What is the need of `-` when we can have something like

```yaml
# Example from https://yaml.org ~sahil.
YAML on GitHub: # github.com/yaml/
  YAML Specs: yaml-spec/
  YAML 1.2 Grammar: yaml-grammar/
  YAML Test Suite: yaml-test-suite/
  YAML Issues: issues/
```

and we can do nest multiple items under a particular property (if we talk about nesting in terms of entities) ?

**Ans.** Its designed to **pass values** whereas other entities with `:` are **key-value pairs**. A `-` in yaml means start of a list though so we can pass multiple values via this list too.

[Ref 1-amaz](https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/5jhff3/when_to_use_dash_in_yaml/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body), [Ref 2-seems amazing too](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/when-to-use-in-yaml-files/62790)

From Ref 1's:

```txt
It may help to convert to JSON.

Hyphens indicate list items. Lists can contain:

1. simple values like strings:

YAML e.g.1

- "string1"
- "string2"

In JSON:

["string1", "string2"]
They can also contain sets of key-value pairs:

YAML e.g.2

- item1key1: "string1"
  item1key2: "string2"
- item2key1: "string3"
  item2key2: "string4"

In JSON:

[{
  item1key1: "string1",
  item1key2: "string2"
},{
  item2key1: "string3",
  item2key2: "string4"
}]
That's what tasks is. Each hyphen starts a new list item (a task), and each list item may have multiple key-value pairs (properties of the task).
```

and another reddit comment about the formatting in the yaml file that helps in readability:

```
Good explanation. I think also what is confusing him is that the list is lumped up in one 'paragraph'. For readability, I would format the above code as:

tasks:
    - name: date/time stamp
      command: /usr/bin/date
      register: timestamp_start

    - debug: var=timestamp_start

    - name: another task
```

## Testing side by side everywhere you write code:

```js
require('colors')

console.assert(user.userName, 'Username is not found..'.red) // only prints the log in red when username is a falsy value.
console.assert(user.age, 'Password not found..'.red) // only prints the log in red when age is a falsy value.

//FYI: Above works in node and browser both. console.assert is just a wrapper over console.error on a false condition and for true it does nothing as like test is passed!
```

[promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all): method takes an iterable of promises as an input, and returns a single Promise that resolves to an array of the results of the input promises. This returned promise will resolve when all of the input's promises have resolved, or if the input iterable contains no promises. It rejects immediately upon any of the input promises rejecting or non-promises throwing an error, and will reject with this first rejection message / error.)

[promise.allSettled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled) (my favourite ~Sahil): The Promise.allSettled() method returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected, with an array of objects that each describes the outcome of each promise. >>>> It is typically used when you have multiple asynchronous tasks that are not dependent on one another to complete successfully, or you'd always like to know the result of each promise. >>>> In comparison, the Promise returned by Promise.all() may be more appropriate if the tasks are dependent on each other / if you'd like to immediately reject upon any of them rejecting.

[promise.any](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any): Promise.any() takes an iterable of Promise objects. It returns a single promise that resolves as soon as any of the promises in the iterable fulfills, with the value of the fulfilled promise. If no promises in the iterable fulfill (if all of the given promises are rejected), then the returned promise is rejected with an AggregateError, a new subclass of Error that groups together individual errors.

[promise.race](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race): The Promise.race() method returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.

There are other iterable based methods in javascript as well on [mdn - amazing docs by mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#static_methods).

## Git

Set default upstream remote branch same as local branch name in git so that when you do `git push` it won't ask you to do `git push -u origin myBranchName` each single time.

```bash
git config --global push.default current #This sets configuration to push to current on remote.
# for pulling you still might need to do it for once for each branch:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main  # Replace main with your desired branch.
```

## Missed some files to add to your git commit ?

```bash
git add the_left_out_file
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

#### Nodemon clear on restart

[Click here](nodemon.md)

## Why does this seems tough ??

```
let s
console.log("s is undefined: ", typeof s === 'undefined') // true

let r = null
console.log("r is null: ", r === null) // true

console.log("s is undefined or null", typeof s === 'undefined' || s === null) // true
console.log("r is undefined or null", typeof r === 'undefined' || r === null) // true
```

## ~~Stop using postman and use curl commands as different files to store requests~~

**_UPDATE: Always prefer using test-driven development using `jest` using shared requests between frontend and backend so there is zero-overhead in request making procedure and code communtication say the api parameter preferences with the frontend team or yourself._**

**First**, bash file commands give you infinite scalability and customizability to store and share requests over github repo, as you can share updated request in that folder and other team memebers can simply use them as it is.

**Second**, bash and curl is opensource, so free forever while with postman -> you can only have at max of 3 members to share your requests with and with that you can only share a limited no. of requests only. So postman sucks when compared with curl command files. Yikes@@

**Third**, variables are also suppored simply using bash scripts, i.e.,

```
$cat staging
v=one

$ cat development
v=two

$cat curl1
echo Firing request @ $v

## We use `. <anyScript>` to run any command in current bash. Tip: `.` is just alias of `source` command.

################ STAGING ENVIRONMENT ################
$ . staging
$ echo $v
one
$ . curl1
Firing request @ one

################ DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ################
$ . development
$ echo $v
two
$ . curl1
Firing request @ two
```

So this way all variables can use used while executing any file with curl command. Yikes!!

Curl cli tip:

- By default when you make request with curl then only response's body is shown. To view the reponse's body and reponse's headers you use user option like `curl -D - my_url` to get response headers as well.
- In fact if you want to see all the details of the request the req's headers as well, the you can simply use `curl -v my_url` to view the verbosed output that has every minute detail you might want to see to debug anything.

## do console.logs in javascript or print in python can cause performance issues ??

YES. How. ?, So, try guessing the time taken of below two programs.

```js
i = 1
console.time()
while (i < 1000) {
	i++
}
console.timeEnd()
```

Output: **0.05 ms**

```js
i = 1
console.time()
while (i < 1000) {
	i++
	console.log('having fun')
}
console.timeEnd()
```

Ouput: **31.6 ms** ( So that means a console.log statement can ruin the performance for sure.

You might be thinking its just in **_ms_**, whats the matter. But not small enough, coz if you add more zeroes to the program the result would be shoking and the proportional changes would be same but in seconds now.

Try doing in python now if you want..

```py
import time

i = 0
while i < 1_000_000:
    # print('hel') # << Here..
    i = i + 1

end = time.perf_counter()
print(end - start)
```

`print` statement uncommented : **.08s** and **3.72s** when **uncommented**. So, thats makes a huge huge difference in performance.

## jump between words in bash, use ctrl+h or backspace ??

#hotkeys, #shortcuts, #linux, #bash

```
#Instead of using backspace in shell, you can use ctrl+h as its far reachable as compared to `backspace key`.
ctrl+h

#word jumping
alt + b : jumb back a word
alt + f : jump forward a word

#char jumping
ctrl + f : jump forward a char
ctrl + b : jump back a char

#alt+l : Also jumps forward a word.

### Use alt+backspace to delete PART of last word
### Use ctrl+backspace to delete last word COMPLETELY.
```

`ctrl+d` closes the terminal itself.

## linux fun

```bash
$ ls -l /mnt/sda3/ /mnt/sda4/ /mnt/sda5/
# This will list out file/directories for all the specified directories above.

$ echo $USER     # Prints username of current user.
$ echo $HOSTNAME # Printes hostname of the machine.
```

## Limitation of javascript (Amazing bigInt type):

```js
console.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) // 9007199254740991


let k
k = 1_000_000_000_000_00_1 * 2
// Output: 2000000000000002
k = 1_000_000_000_000_000_1 * 2
// Output: 20000000000000000 // Notice the end digit is calculated wrong JAVASCRIPT sucks in artronomical figures.

// Fixing issue: Use bigints in javascript
// Syntax: Just add n to the end of the number and thats a bigInt.

let k
k = 1_000_000_000_000_000_1n * 2
// ^^ above expression throws error as ->>
// VM52:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types, use explicit conversions
// So, instead we try with 2n (earlier we used 2 (number type) to multiply with a BigInt type.
k = 1_000_000_000_000_000_1n * 2n
20000000000000002n // Voila! It works!!
```

Read about bigint @ MDN [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt).

## Format a disk/usb in windows with `diskpart`

```
diskpart
list disk
select disk X
clean
create partition primary
select partition 1
active
format fs=ntfs label=sanDisk quick
assign letter=h
exit


# Also, you can list and select a partition too.
list partition
select partition Y
```

## Become root user

`sudo su`

---

_Missing beauty:_ `isBoolean = (a) => typeof a === 'boolean'`

_Recall last n commits in git:_ `git log -n 1`, `git log -n2` works well similarly, i.e., showing last two logs.

## Generating ssh key pairs

**Learn a public key is always contained inside the private key, you can get that public key using openssl anytime. Read extracting public key and ssh-public key generation from private file in cli at https://stackoverflow.com/a/5246045/10012446.** Read how private-public [keys work together here](https://www.devco.net/archives/2006/02/13/public_-_private_key_encryption_using_openssl.php).

```bash
# Simple ssh keys generation:
ssh-keygen
#Note if you give filename as myfile, then output will be: myfile and myfile.pub, where myfile is private key and myfile.pub is public key.


# Generating sshkyes using github recommended algorithm:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"


# Note: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"


# Generate myfile.ppk and myfile.ppk.pub (With no prompts for filename, and do set passphrase in prompts):
ssh-keygen -f myfile.ppk
# Output: Two files will be generated i.e, priv key and public key respectively.
# myfile.ppk  myfile.ppk.pub
```

## Setup your cli to work with different github accounts

First add your **public key** to github account you want access to. Then add entry correspondingly like below to your `~/.ssh/config` file.

`vi ~/.ssh/config`

and enter code like below:

```bash
HOST github.com
 HostName github.com
 IdentityFile "C:\Users\Array\Documents\ssh-keys\sahil-account-1-private-key"

HOST github.com-sahilrajput03
 HostName github.com
 IdentityFile "C:\Users\Array\Documents\ssh-keys\sahil-account-2-private-key"
```

## Get ur ip address

```
curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com
# Below works too.
curl checkip.amazonaws.com
```

### Save some of keystrokes with logs

```js
// commonjs
const {log: l} = require('console')
l('i love commonjs modules.')

//esm
import {log as l} from 'console'
l('i love esm modules')
```

### Get used to javascript objects(works good in both node and browser both, tested):

```js
var cron = require('node-cron')
let cron1 = '30 * * * * *'

cron.schedule(cron1, () => {
	var d = new Date()
	var h = d.getHours()
	var m = d.getMinutes()
	var s = d.getSeconds()

	console.log('==1>', new Date().toLocaleString())
	console.log('==2>', h) // 20 that means 8pm.
	console.log('==3>', m) // 32 that means 32 minutes past.
	console.log('==4>', s) // 30 that means 30 seconds past.
	console.log('==5>', d) // this is not readable at all :lol:
})
```

- You can always use ?. operator in browser and react projects irrespective of if you are using typescript or not. Yes, its fun, isn't it.!

\*You need to press y for first time though.

- Super charge your windows bash experience with my aliases and functions:

```bash
curl -o ~/.bashrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahilrajput03/my_bin/master/files/.bashrc-windows/.bashrc
# This command simply adds/updates your existing `~/.bashrc file`. Too much fun, isn't it :)
```

- Add `prettier-write` script to your package.json file using command

```bash
npm set-script prettier-write "prettier --write ."
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahilrajput03/my_bin/master/files/.prettierrc.js
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahilrajput03/my_bin/master/files/.prettierignore
```

- Make emmet work on your jsx files as well

Enable Setting: `Emmet: Trigger Expand On Tab` and set `ctrl+e` as key binding for `Emmet: Expand Abbreviation`. Enjoy emmet in JSX with ctrl+e now for the rest of life.

- Want Husky? [VERIFIED] :

```bash
npx husky-init && npm install
```

Now edit the `.husky/pre-commit` file and add desired command i.e., `npm run prettier-write` there in place of command `npm test`. And don't forget to tell other contributors to use below command to get their husky setup on rocket for their future commits.

```
npm i
```

Help: [Src1](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/), [Src2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWty0Nw1ydk), [Src3: CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-up-your-editor/#formatting-code-automatically).

- **Got time**

0. Read and test whole official [cra docs](https://create-react-app.dev/).
1. Learn [story book or styleguidist](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/developing-components-in-isolation) , either one and do some good tutorial from their site or youtube. :D GOOD LUCK!!
2. Leanr pre-rendering from cra docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/pre-rendering-into-static-html-files).

## My favourite drawing app

## 🤠︎ Write data to a new/existing file directly with the terminal

Copy data to clipboard, and in terminal use

`$ cat > myFile.txt` and hit enter, and now paste data in the terminal itself and press `ctrl+d` to save the file. Thats it 🤠︎.

`$ cat >> myFile.txt` and this will append data to the end of the content of the fiile, and make sure you first enter a new line after you press enter command for the above command so that a new line is created (only useful when there is no new line already in end of file that you want to edit).

## Priority1: Center element using simple margin auto

Q. Does margin auto center vertically?
Ans. If the display of your parent container is flex , then yes, margin: auto auto (also known as margin: auto ) will work to center it both horizontally and vertically, regardless if it is an inline or block element.

## Priority2: Center element like a pro

```css
.myElement {
	position: absolute/relative;
	transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
	top: 50%;
	left: 50%;
}
```

## Priority3: Center element like a master

```css
.myEl{
 position: absolute;
 top: 0;
 left: 0;
 right: 0;
 bottom: 0;

 width: 50%;
 height: 50%;
 margin: auto;
 <!-- ^ this does the centering magic when complemented with all the above settings and don't forget to make the container of current element as ''position: relative'' -->
}

.container{
 position: relative;
}

```

## css selector

```css
p ~ ul {
	background: #ff0000;
	/*This will apply to all ul's that are anywhere(not just next to it) after the p tag.*/
}
```
