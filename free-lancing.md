```js
When we assign the task, we will be considering these points:

1) quality of code you deliver

2) how quickly you're able to complete the ticket

3) autonomy - your ability to solve problems on your own, outside of information we have

I hope this is helpful

#### Getting project [src](https://youtu.be/p76zsTDqahM)

- Keep expectations low and understanding that compounding works.
- You have to raise to 150$/hr. Don't forget the power of compounding bcoz it always happens.
- You won't get a project until you apply to a 100 @upwork. Some people apply to three projects and get no response then they just shut off. Apply the maths that I'm going to get 1% of the projects I apply to. Take a crack at 100, 5 will reply and out of which 1 will convert because if someone is replying that doesn't mean one will give you the project.
- Have a humble cover letter. I am learning and I'm trying to get better. Humility works much much better and lands you the first project.
- 99% of people in India don't believe in the freelancing, they like the idea but they don't believe that its possible to run a career on it.

#### Client Handling (single big mistake that pisses the client)

A client would love to work with if you would have a constant conversative (constant here means that conversing each day otherwise the client would think that freelancer is fraud and simply stolen the money). ~ Varun Mayya

#### money and all

- Gross Income: Totoal income from 1 April to 31 March.
- Net Income: Gross - Expenses spend on doing business (e.g., time tracking software service cost)
- Microeconomics is the study of what is likely to happen (tendencies) when individuals make choices in response to changes in incentives, prices, resources, and/or methods of production.
- Learn about [Microeconomics @ Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microeconomics.asp).
- Have multiple bank accounts: Monthly Spend Account(+15K every month): The goal of this account to go broke with your spendings, Spludge Account (for long term desiral things like Bike, Car, Home and this can be used to fund in worst cases when you don't a project in future)
- Make contracts for freelancing via https://www.hellobonsai.com/.

## money earnnig comparison?

Earning 35k Rs/month => `22days*8hrs` = `176hrs` i.e., `35,000RS/176HRS` = `200Rs/hr` = `2.52$/hr`

## Upwork proposals 8 golden rules
[1](https://youtu.be/f4INGRluDAU), [2]()
1. Use client's first name from the history of client.
2. CTA (Call To Action) - Book a call to you via something like calendarly IMO.
3. Be concise and show social proof.
4. Make use of P.S. in the [end of the proposal](https://www.wix.com/wordsmatter/blog/2020/10/what-does-ps-mean/).
5. Take and hour and read throught Upwork TOS.


- CTA (Call To Action): https://calendly.com/sahilrajput03/30min

  For popup thing in the same webpage:

  ```html
  <!-- Calendly link widget begin -->
  <link href="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <script src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>
  <a href="" onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/sahilrajput03/30min'});return false;">Schedule time with me</a>
  <!-- Calendly link widget end -->
  ```
