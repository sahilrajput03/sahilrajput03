# 0. To run contents of wordpress.zip file downloaded from wordpress.org you need to put it into `htdocs` directory and extract it to a folder names of your project say `mysite1`.
# 1. You can need to start apache and mysql server as wordpress needs it. You need to create a database named `mysite1` so wordpress can access it.
# 2. You can setup wordpress now by visiting: http://localhost/mysite1
```
