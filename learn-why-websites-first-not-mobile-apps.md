# Learn: Why people want their service (restaurant, hotel, etc ) available first on website and only then on mobile native apps

I always wondered why would my website development skills can be truly valuable to any client or company? And often I don't find good enough reasons to make myself feel good, rather I face this fear that mobile developers are providing real interface that often people end up using with much move convenience from their app stores and istores.

So, here's some real world valuable points that matters to anybody providing some service online so here are some points:

- They want themselves to be discoverable on google (so SSR for pages is must for your site). Use nextjs by default as a developer.
- Search is the organic traffic from google thats where most people already are, you just need to go into that area to be servicable and being not there is just not feasible coz even when you tell people about your company's url they're not gonna type it in the url but in the search bar, thats truth.
- You can have yourself advertised so peolpe searchin for specific genres get to see relevant service of yours. Better reach is so sure shot to invest using google ads.
