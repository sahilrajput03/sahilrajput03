<ins>**CHAWMIN**</ins>

Note: If the noodles are too long then break it into half .. and still they will be large enough to be enjoyed.

- Are Chawmin and Noodles different? : Noodles is basically a type of food that is made from dough, while chow-mein is a dish made with noodles. Actually, chow mein is coined from two words `chow` which means fried, and `mein` refers to noodles. So the moral of the story is all chow mein are noodles, but all noodles are not chow mein.

Procedure:
- Put noodles in boiling water(least enough water so noodles are immersed into) and boil for exactly 4 minutes and boil on medium flame.
- Now put out boiled noodles and keep them in big bowl/plate and add two full tbsp of oil/ghee into it and mix well the oil using two chop sticks/ fork. This makes sure that noodles wont stick to each other.
- Now put 2 tbsp of oil/ghee in a pan and boil it and add all the nice small chopped veggies and cook for 3-4 min on mid flame and dont overcook else the texture of veggies would get bad and wont be enjoyable when served.
- Now add the noodles into pan, keep flame at medium. Use two chop sticks/fork to mix noodles and maggi masal/chingsFriedRiceMasala/chingsChawMasala {do add few drops of water on top of masala so it mix easily} and cook for 3-4 more mins. NOW ITS READY TO BE SERVED!!.;

<ins>**ICE-CREAM RANVEER KITCHEN (only single freeze needed)**</ins>

Prerequisites:

- SPECIAL: Add nicely broken almonds, kishmish and other dry fruits.
- EXTRAS:
