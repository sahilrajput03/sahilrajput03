## install macos-simple-kvm

**IMPORTANT: USE ctrl+alt+g to toggle mouse into/out from qemu screen.**

**IMPORTANT: USE ctrl+alt+f to toggle fullscreen.**

```bash
# Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Otg7JFMuVw
# Article: https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-run-macos-on-kvm-qemu/

# Source Project: https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM
gcl git@github.com:foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM.git
cd macOS-Simple-KVM

# Download (500M) and uncompress it to `BaseSystem.img` (2G)
./jumpstart.sh

# Create disk image (20G) is minimum as they say in FAQ's: https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM/blob/master/docs/FAQs.md
# This creates a file `MyDisk.qcow2` (of size 196K) in current directory.
# HELP: Use `Enter` to press the ```Boot Install Macos``` BUTTON. ALSO IN DISK UTILITY, You need to format the disk.
qemu-img create -f qcow2 MyDisk.qcow2 28G
# FYI: For 25.21G is mimimum requirement for `catalina - macos` ~Sahil

## Addbelow lines to basic.sh file (remove `#` though from each line):
#    -drive id=SystemDisk,if=none,file=MyDisk.qcow2 \
#    -device ide-hd,bus=sata.4,drive=SystemDisk \

### SRC: https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM/blob/master/docs/guide-performance.md
## Also add memory usage to
#    -m 6G \
## add cpu cores as well by chaing below line
#     -smp 4,cores=2 \
# to...
#     -smp cores=4,threads=8,sockets=1 \
    

# Run basic.sh to start macos installation (need to use this to run macos everytime):
./basic.sh
# FYI: `Clover` is used as boot manager for macos-simple-kvm and other hackintoshes as well.

# While installation
# 1. You need to go to `Disk Utility` and select the largest disk (which corresponds to disk file we created earlier with `qemu-img` command)
# 2. Click on `Erase` and and choose some name for disk `disk1` and choose format as `APFS` and click on `Erase` now.
# 3. Now go back from `Disk Utility` and choose `Reinstall macos`, yo!! It will simply install!

## AFTER INSTALLATION WE CAN IMPROVE THE PERFORMANE VIA
- increasing `Memory Allocation`
- increasing `number of `CPU cores`
- increasing `number of threads cpu can handle`
- increasing `screen resolution`
- adding any passthroughs through say for e.g., GPU
```

## installed `sshfs`

**More Tools: `rsync` and `scp` to copy files b/w host and remote server.** You can refer [previous experience here](https://github.com/sahilrajput03/sahilrajput03/blob/master/missing-semester/LECTURE5.md).

Mount remote machine path to local directory using `sshfs`, amazing mounting tool! `sshfs` uses ssh protocol to do this. Also `sshfs` recognises your `.ssh/config` file thus you can make use of aliases very well as I have used `own` alias for my own system.

#mout remote, #mount over ssh, #mimic remote folder, #mimic remote drive, #folder mount with ssh.

```bash
sudo pacman -S sshfs

# 4.5k stars @github: https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs

# Usage:
# Mounting:
sshfs myuser@mycomputer:/remote/path /local/path -C -p 9876

# Unmounting:
fusermount3 -u mountpoint/
Source: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSHFS
```

**Example test:**

```bash
mkdir one two
ls
# Output:
one  two

# Mounting remote server's directory (one) to host machine (two)
sshfs own:test/test-sshfs/one ./two

# create file in remote machine:
touch one/file1.txt
ls two/
# Output:
file1.txt

# create file in host machine:
touch two/file2.txt

ls one/
# Output:
file1.txt  file2.txt

# Unmounting
fusermount3 -u two/

## installed `pdflatex`

## installed `hyperfine` - a benchmarking tool for linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S hyperfine

# Docs: https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine

# Sample usage:
hyperfine 'sleep 0.3'
hyperfine --runs 5 'sleep 0.3'

# If you want to compare the runtimes of different programs, you can pass multiple commands:
hyperfine 'hexdump file' 'xxd file'

### warmup and cold runs: https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine#warmup-runs-and-preparation-commands

# Warmup runs and preparation commands: For programs that perform a lot of disk I/O, the benchmarking results can be heavily influenced by disk caches and whether they are cold or warm. If you want to run the benchmark on a warm cache, you can use the -w/--warmup option to perform a certain number of program executions before the actual benchmark:
hyperfine --warmup 3 'grep -R TODO *'

# Conversely, if you want to run the benchmark for a cold cache, you can use the -p/--prepare option to run a special command before each timing run. For example, to clear harddisk caches on Linux. Conversely, if you want to run the benchmark for a cold cache, you can use the -p/--prepare option to run a special command before each timing run. For example, to clear harddisk caches on Linux, you can run
hyperfine --prepare 'sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' 'grep -R TODO *'

## Installed neovim

[neovim - Archwiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Neovim), [neovim - Arch package](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/neovim/).

```
sudo pacman -S neovim
# neovim uses your .vimrc file as well (idk, update 28 april 2022)


#### Installing on debian based (works well on ubuntu)
# 1. Download a release build from below i.e., a `.deb` file
# https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases
wget https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/stable/nvim-linux64.deb

# 2. Install it and done!
sudo apt install ./my-package.deb



## Problems with installation on any server?
# With ubuntu all went well but cursor doesn't change to line shape coz the os doesn't support.
# With debian all went well + cursor shaping in insert mode works very good so it confirms that ubuntu lacks something that prevents cursor shaping when we go in insert mode. Yikes! DEBIAN rocks!

## Installed tmux:

# bind a "respawn-pane -k"


## Command to run a command in new pane ? 
# Ans. tmux split-window "echo hello;sleep 100"       ###so this will run the command in new pane, yikes!!
# src: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/152740/504112

## You can switch between sessions in tmux via: ctr+( or ctrl+) and also you can do something like `ctrl+t s` to switch using a preview as well. Yikes! Src: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32790061/switch-between-sessions-in-tmux

## Enable synchronize-panes by pressing `ctrl+t` followed by `shift+:` and next type `set synchronize-panes` on at the prompt. Now all the panes in the current window will be synced such that any thing you type will be done to all the panes. To disable synchronization: set synchronize-panes off.

 Arrange panes in one of the five preset layouts: even-
            horizontal, even-vertical, main-horizontal, main-
            vertical, or tiled.



# Usage:
tmux    # Good to go now!
tmux -V # Know your tmux version.

# So, your ```bind-key``` is C-t (i.e., control+t, but otherwise it is control-b by default IMO ~sahil.)
# FYI: ```C-t C-? List of key bindings.``` (i.e., control+a control+? to open list of shortcuts, FYI: press ```q``` to exit it).

# WOW:: For selecting text from command ouput: Use ```C-a [``` to enter the ```copy mode``` and then you are in vim mode and simply use v or V and y to yank text and press ```q``` to exit. Yikes!!!
# WOW:: Use ```C-t ?``` to open the help menu in tmux and press ```q``` to exit it.
# Others:

C-t & to kill the current window
C-t x to kill the current pane
C-t <space> to change current panes to horizontal, vertical, or comple multiple adjustments.

# witching to a pane with pane numbers:
C-t q to show the pane numbers (press esc to exit that)
FYI: While the numbers are on top of panes you can switch to that pane by pressign the corresponding pane number as well.
FYI: You need to confirm killing the window with x by default but you can disable the confirmation for both pane and window by following this:  https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/30283/504112

C-t % to make new pane towards right.
C-t " to make new pane downwards.
C-t n to make a new window. # My custom hotkey.
# ALSO: Use ctrl+d to kill pane (this is a general terminal keybinding to kill any terminal though).

# Now refer this blos post: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/
# Also do use .screenrc file and add ```startup_message off``` as suggested in above article to open it without initial message.

screen -wipe # To kill the detached session.
screen -wipe <ID> # TO kill a session with a particular id (you need this command only when there are more than 1 active sessions). Src: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/94527/how-do-i-kill-all-screens/170949#170949

## Installed `inotify-tools` for `inotifywait`

Wow, even facebook's watchman also uses `inotifywait` underneath [src](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).

```bash
sudo pacman -S inotify-tools
```

````bash
# BEAUTIFUL READY MADE SCRIPT:
inotifywait -q -m -r -e close_write --exclude '.git/*' --format 'Wrote file %w%f' . # We're watching complete directory and recursively as well.
# FYI You can append ```| sh``` at the end of above command to execute the formatted message as shell commands DIRECTLY as well. (See below source link to know 1 usecase of this).
# source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/420172/10012446 ((But the problem with << this answer is that it watches over a file and when we watch over a single file like that (i.e., say `file.txt`) then %f doesn't seem to work at all IDK WHY, but it simply works if we watch over a complete directory via a . {period} )).
# FYI: %f is the filename and %w is the directory path in which the just changed file exists.

# Another way of doing it if you want to include a while loop (IMO{sahil}: its not at all necessary coz above one-liner performs all good!).
inotifywait -q -m -r -e close_write --exclude '.git/*' --format '%f' . | while read FILE; do echo "$FILE written."; done

# ~sahil: Watch over file and execute that file i.e., ```1.sh```. Inspired from a comment in answer from below stackoverflow's answer.
# The drawback of this way instead of original answer's way i.e. using `read -r` is that when the command is in the process of execution(i.e., 1.sh) inotifywait won't be able to get signal of file write event, thus this simple looking way fails to work good enough for cases like running a express's node server which runs indefinitely and one needs to kill the process and start it again on file write changes. Yikes!

# Watch over file and execute that file i.e., ```1.sh```.
# src: https://superuser.com/a/181543/776589
# tl;dr: Since we're using `-m` (monitor) flag so our the command(./1.s) is queued and run sequentially only when the last instance completely finishes!
# The problem with this solution is that when the file is in execution phase (i.e., 1.sh) the script doesn't kill the existing running process but instead for getting it completed/exited and then only the event of running the file starts. So in simple terms it does listen to file changes even when the file (1.sh) is in execution phase but the problem is it doesn't kill the existing process and thus all write events triggered actions are queued. So such mechanish is not good for cases like running a express's node server which runs indefinitely and one needs to kill the process and start it again on file write changes. Yikes!
inotifywait -q -m -e close_write 1.sh |

# ~sahil: Watch over current directory recursively and execute ```1.sh``` file.
inotifywait -q -m -e close_write -r . |

# Note the ```-r .``` option will watch over the current directory in recursive manner.

# -e|--event <event1> [ -e|--event <event2> ... ]
# Listen for specific event(s).  If omitted, all events are listened for.

# Watch directories recursively.

# --format <fmt>
# Print using a specified printf-like format string; read the man page for more details.

## Setting up android environment with vscode

Arch's article: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/android#SDK_packages

##### Permission of certificates permission denied ISSUE FIXED !! :

Installed sdkmanager in archos

Fixed as: https://stackoverflow.com/a/54273442/10012446

Vscode Extension: _Android full Support_ helps to create fresh projects and also facilitates sdkmanager from command pallete in android studio.

https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources

[Build your app from the command line @ Android Studio Docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline)

#### 1. java

```
#install java/javac in system.
sudo pacman -S jre11-openjdk
java --version

sudo pacman -S jdk11-openjdk
javac --version
```

#### 2. install platform-tools

````
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/android-sdk-platform-tools/
cd android-sdk-platform-tools
makepkg -s
sudo pacman -U android-platform-sdk-tools-x.x.x....tar.zst

# https://stackoverflow.com/a/9210397/10012446
# that helped me to get rid of ```adb devices``` error of no-permission, Yikes!! ALSO You would need to accept the permission on this very time when you connect the device again. And it'll show the device as ```adb devices``` >> ```<device-id> device```

# You need to source /etc/profile or relogin to add the Android SDK platform tools to your path.

# For vscode's extension use the platform-tools you can define `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` variable must be pointing to platform-tools directory.
# So add a variable entry in /etc/environment file as
ANDROID_SDK_ROOT='/opt/android-sdk'

and run so vscode get permission to read/write to /opt/android-sdk folder.
sudo chmod g+rwx /opt/android-sdk
sudo chmod o+rwx /opt/android-sdk

# and logout and login, now vscode's extension would pick right path for android-sdk and you would be able to access adb cli's tool as well. If above android-platform-sdk-tools cause issue you can simply remove and reinstall the the tools again from the sdk manager in vscode. Yikes!
````

Platform-tools installed @ `/opt/android-sdk/platform-tools/`

#### 3. Android sdk

Installing `Android 10 (API 29)` from the _Open SDK Manager_ in the vscode's extension.

In the Android 10(API 29): Choose `SDK Platform`, `Google APIs Intelx86 Atom_64 System Image` and `Sources for AndroidSDK`. Also, you can choose to install `Android SDK Platform-tools` or ignore if you installed that from _arch's AUR_ before.

## installed kotlin archos

```
sudo pacman -Syyu
sudo pacman kotlin
```

Official installation [source](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html#create-and-run-an-application),

## Installed mongodb - archos

Src: [1](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MongoDB), [2](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mongodb-bin/).

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mongodb-bin.git
cd mongodb-bin
makepkg -s
sudo pacman -U mongodb-bin....tar.zst

# Run mongodb server:
sudo systemctl start mongodb

# To enable mongodb service to run on system startup:
sudo systemctl enable mongodb
```

## Set vim as editor via git instead of vi (it throws errror bcoz of that)

```
git config --global core.editor vim
```

## Installed speedtest on arch

```
sudo pacman -S speedtest-cli
# Usage:
speedtest
```

Src: https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/speedtest-cli/

## Detect if a service i.e., services in `systemctl` is enabled (starts on boot) ?

```bash
systemctl is-enabled code-server@array
#src: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/599587/504112

# when the service is enabled: sudo systemctl enable code-server@array
#Output: enabled

# when the service is disabled: sudo systemctl disable code-server@array
#Output: disabled
```

src: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/599587/504112

read lots of below from: https://www.howtogeek.com/412055/37-important-linux-commands-you-should-know/

## Recursiveness in ls or tree

```
ls -R -I node_modules* -I debug* -I build* -I deps*
# Prints everything recursively (-R) and ignored patters like node_modules, build, deps. Yikes!!

tree -I 'arch_os|target|rustlings|target|node_modules'
# PRints everything recursively, src: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/47806/504112
```

## head and tail

```bash
head -n 5 someFile #prints first 5 lines of file.
tail -n 5 someFile #prints last 5 lines of file.
```

## Terminal - seaching previous commands ?

Type some text in terminal and press `ctrl+r` - Activate search mode.

Now press `ctrl+r` multiple times to search back in order(fyi: there's no way to forward search, :( sad). **FYI**: Its not really good experience to use that. ~Sahil.

`ctrl+g` - Exit search mode.

Other good way to seach in previous commands in like:

```bash
history n # n is number and it give last n number of commands(including the commands you executed in current shell as well).
history 300 | grep scp | grep important$
```

The most amazing experience to solve this is via using `hh` cli tool, i.e., #see `hstr` in this file for help for using that.

## Installed docker, docker-compose in archos

````bash
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose

sudo systemctl enable docker.service #So that docker automatically starts on system boot.
sudo systemctl start docker
# Fix permission issue for socket i.e., ```/var/run/docker.sock``` # Source: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket#)
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

# PLEASE REBOOT(reboot means reboot and not just logout and login) THE SYSTEM ONCE PLEASE TO BE ABLE TO GET DOCKER FUNCTIONING. src: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55911400/10012446

# Test if docker is running GOOD via:
sudo systemctl status docker # OR
docker info # OR
docker ps -aux
````

## Installed postgresql in archos

```
sudo pacman -S postgresql
To setup the configuration now please follow @ https://github.com/sahilrajput03/learning_sql/blob/main/setup-postgres.md)
```

## Installed Watchexec ( a program watch execution on modification, written with rust!

```
sudo pacman -S watchexec
# Usage: watchexec -c ./fly.sh    # -c is option for clearning screen on each run.
```

FYI: The problem with `nodmeon -x "bash $@"` was that it seemed to supress some message like when have a script like:

```bash
read -p "Enter your name" name # with nodemon it does print ""Enter your name"" which get printed when you run wihtout nodemon. So watchexec rocks!
echo $name
```

## Installed gui interface for postgres i.e., pgadmin4

```bash
### installation via pip :)
# Browse: https://github.com/sahilrajput03/learning_sql/blob/main/Notes_pgadmin4_install.md

## Installing nvm:

src: [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nvm/)

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/nvm.git
cd nvm
makepkg -s
sudo pacman -U nvm-*******-any.pkg.tar.zst
echo 'source /usr/share/nvm/init-nvm.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### Insall yarn my arch setup

`npm i -g yarn`

## Linux fun:

```bash
. --help # is same as
source --help
```

## Define variables in arch-os

```
sudo vim /etc/environment
# Now add some value pairs, i.e., v1=value1 one in each line and you would be able to test them i.e., `echo $v1` once after logout/login event.
# Tip if you want to access the variables in current bash in hurry.., simply do like `. /etc/environment` to test your `/etc/environment` file in current bash shell only.
```

## Installed dig cli tool

```
sudo pacman -Sy dnsutils
```

[Source](https://www.tecmint.com/install-dig-and-nslookup-in-linux/#digarch)

## Pushing archLinux.iso to a usb:

```
dd: disk dump (people also call it as disk destroyer, coz if not used correct drive it'll destroy the target drive).
man dd: to read its documentation.


dd if=Downloads/archlinux_64.iso of=/dev/sdb
# if=inputFile, of=ouputFile.
# be careful that your of (output file) i.e., if its gonna be extremely right device you want the iso file's data to be dumped off.
```

## Why prefer pacman ?

Bcoz if you ever run `pacman -Syu` then all your packages installed via pacman will be updated.

## Installed chromium

```
sudo pacman -S chromium
```

If you get some error then you can use `sudo pacman -Syu` to upgrade the system and probably the problem will be fixed as [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67552506/10012446) helped me.

## Update system

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

Installed code-server via below commands

src:

```
# Install code-server from the AUR with plain makepkg.
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/code-server.git
cd code-server
makepkg -si
sudo systemctl enable --now code-server@$USER
# Now visit http://127.0.0.1:8080. Your password is in ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

## setting up ssh

```bash
sudo pacman -S openssh

# check the status:
sudo systemctl status sshd

#start service if above command shows ``inactive``
sudo systemctl start sshd

# now check again the status and it should be active for sure.

# to stop ssh server:
sudo systemctl stop sshd
```

## Ranger

- Ranger Docs in Archlinux: [Click here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ranger#Configuration)
- Ranger - [Github](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

- **Use `S` in ranger to return to shell in current folder.**

### Ranger shwoing images in terminal is awesome

Source: https://askubuntu.com/a/1268970/702911

```bash
# create a user specific rangerconfig file if it doesn't exist already
cp /usr/share/doc/ranger/config/rc.conf ~/ranger/

# edit config file
vi ~/ranger/rc.conf

# Then make below changes:
set preview_images true
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31458531/193551184-39b6f9ed-e987-4275-b8df-9c0d02120ead.png)


### Configuring`ranger` and setting `google-chrome-stable` as defautl pdf viewwer:

```bash
# copy default config file of ranger to .config/ranger/rifle.conf path, so we can customise it on user basis.
ranger --copy-config=rifle

# move config folder to /home/array path becoz reading from `man rifle` command we need to have the `ranger` config folder at `/home/array` becoz we have already have set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/array` so rifle is gonna look for the config file in `/home/array/ranger/rifle.conf` path
mv /home/array/.config/ranger/ /home/array/

# modifying user config file
vi.ranger # which is aliased to below `vi ~/ranger/rifle.conf`
```

and now add below line where you have other pdf extension openers defined in there:

```bash
ext pdf, has google-chrome-stable,     X, flag f = google-chrome-stable "$@"
```


### Config file of rifle not working?

Since I have set my variable `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set as `/home/array` (see in .bashrc) to konw whey I set that varaible to that value(spoiler: to make neovim's config work).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31458531/193546601-493d1af4-4e5d-449d-8538-b8a4629372a4.png)

And also, from output of command: `man rifle`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31458531/193546326-692727ff-2d42-4f92-8636-72122a779170.png)

so we need to run below command to fix the config folder path to make ranger and rifle work (ranger uses rifle internally to select set default program openers for different types of files):

```bash
mv /home/array/.config/ranger/ /home/array/
```

## Installing `comfortable-motion` and `vim-plug`

Install vim-plug(a vim plugin manager):
LEARN vim-plug -> https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#example

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

now, add config to `~/.vimrc` file i.e., code from: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#example.

**OR tl;dr; add below code directly:**

```
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

Plug 'yuttie/comfortable-motion.vim'
" More plugins here.

call plug#end()
```

**IMPORTANT:** Reload `.vimrc` and `:PlugInstall` to install plugins.

## Disable capslock completely (ROCKS!)

Updated on: 16th April, 2022

**FYI: The file `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf` is backuped at `config` repository as well!! So you can directly copy that file to its needed location anytime to get your settings.**

Stackoverflow Amazing Answer - [xmodmap - remap Caps_Lock to Escape and Shift+Caps_Lock to Caps_Lock](https://superuser.com/a/1471357)

**Learn how to make sample config files from scratch from below link of arch docs:** [Click here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg/Keyboard_configuration#Using_X_configuration_files)

Source: [Using config files of x11 @ ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg#Using_.conf_files)

**tldr;**

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf
```

and add below code in the tripple backticks:

```txt
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "system-keyboard"
        MatchIsKeyboard "on"
#        Option "XkbLayout" "cz,us"
#        Option "XkbModel" "pc104"

#        Option "XkbOptions" "grp:win_space_toggle"
	Option "XkbOptions" "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp,caps:escape"
# Currently, I am completely disabling capslock      ^----------^
EndSection
```

My useful notes:

```txt
# FYI: Read all available optinos via: cat /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst
# FYI: The options should be separated by comma as you can see above^^^^^
# FYI: ctrl+alt+backspace will simly logout.

# Usefult options to see:
# terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp Ctrl+Alt+Backspace (( ~Sahil, this will logout in superfast manner without any confirmation.
# caps:escape_shifted_capslock Make Caps Lock an additional Esc, but Shift + Caps Lock is the regular Caps Lock
# caps:none            Caps Lock is disabled
# caps:escape          Make Caps Lock an additional Esc
```

## Enabling hibernation in archlinux

1. LEARN: ::About What all needs to be done in order to make hibernation work when you already have a swap partition and have a entry for it in the `/etc/fstab` file::

One thing I remember, I needed to point the kernel to the swap partition on the kernel command line. This is described somewhere in the ArchWiki article about hibernation. There might also be changes needed in the HOOKS= line in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf, but I don't quite remember. This will also be mentioned somewhere in the wiki article.

I occasionally have problems with hibernation depending on the kernel version. Some versions don't work right for my PC here. I don't think that's the problem for you from the way you describe what's happening, but I guess you could still try a different kernel version to check. There's an alternative one in the package named linux-lts. You can install it in parallel to the normal linux package. You need to look up how to add a second boot menu entry for it with the boot loader you are using.

src: https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/7swvyb/cannot_restore_session_after_hibernation/?utm_source=reddit-android

2. LEARN ::About adding entry in the `/etc/default/grub` file::
   https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB
   ^^ search for hibernation keyword and you'll get the necessary things you need to do in file - `/etc/default/grub` in variable - `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`.
