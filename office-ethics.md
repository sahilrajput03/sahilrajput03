# Office Ethics

- Fridays should be no exercise and jump start the day with tea.
- Always message your manager when you start your day and 30 minutes before you close the day as it can help them realize that you're responsible, available and focussed on work instead of having them think that they always need to give separate time to manage you. Thus you are your own manager this way.
- Always try to time-bound a task by using the jira tool if possible as it gives you more freedom, confidence and power to you in the long term as a responsible tech leader.
- Always check all the ticket before you start your day or whenever tickets are assigned to you because some issue might be:
  - redundant
  - need just your code review, which can be interesting to do and might only take 10 mins to do
  - just need some suggestion from you and thus clear you as the dependency on the task progress
  - very short task that it doesn't need to make the list look long, thus just fix it immediately if you can afford it. OR just prioritize that first on the task list as it'll give you confidence.
- Laziness and procrastination will kill you if you don't kill them.
- Say no to ticket together for review only for tickets together if there possible merge conflicts **unless at 3x working price**. Remember at the time of hashtag feature, while making nightly-branch locally each time when we the manager asks for full review build leading to developer experience getting a lot worse because of "Merge Conflicts" when we want to re merge all the branches only for the purpose of review and sadly only to release a few of them. Why say No? Because fixing change in one branch can result in doing all the local merge via the nightly branch can be avoided on each iteration of the development process of individual features.
