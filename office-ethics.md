# Office Ethics

- Fridays should be no exercise and jump start the day with tea.
- Always message your manager when you start your day and 30 minutes before you close the day as it can help them realize that you're responsible, available and focussed on work instead of having them think that they always need to give separate time to manage you. Thus you are your own manager this way.
- Always try to time-bound a task by using the jira tool if possible as it gives you more freedom, confidence and power to you in the long term as a responsible tech leader.
- Always check all the ticket before you start your day or whenever tickets are assigned to you because some issue might be:
  - redundant
  - need just your code review, which can be interesting to do and might only take 10 mins to do
  - just need some suggestion from you and thus clear you as the dependency on the task progress
  - very short task that it doesn't need to make the list look long, thus just fix it immediately if you can afford it. OR just prioritize that first on the task list as it'll give you confidence.
- Laziness and procrastination will kill you if you don't kill them.
