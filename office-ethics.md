# Office Ethics

- Always check all the ticket before you start your day or whenever tickets are assigned to you because some issue might be:
  - redundant
  - need just your code review
  - just need some suggestion from you and thus clear you as the dependency on the task progress
  - very short task that it doesn't need to make the list look long, thus just fix it immediately if you can afford it. OR just prioritize that first on the task list as it'll give you confidence.
- Always try to time-bound a task by using the jira tool if possible as it gives you more freedom, confidence and power to you in long term as responsible tech leader.
