## Reading ping command output:

> Read the "Approximate round trip times" section to obtain a general idea of your connection speed. The higher the average time in milliseconds, the slower the connection to the server. Ping times to computers and servers on your local network will usually be much faster than those on the Internet.

## Make a script available to be run by dmenu

```bash
#!/bin/bash
source ~/.bash_functions
air google-chrome-stable --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

Now save that file as name `google-chrome-stable-debug` and move file to `/usr/bin/` directory with `sudo` privilidges. YIKES! Now you can access the bin in dmenu launcher in your archos.

## Run node inspector with nvm setup (windows)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
npx cross-env DEBUG=bspaces-api:* PORT=8080 nodemon --inspect -x "C:\Users\Dell\AppData\Roaming\nvm\v12.19.0\node.exe" ./bin/www
# This is to use node version 12 via my nvm setup automatically.
# Please use debuggint script with name - "Attach to node process((hint: which has ``node --inpect``))" to connect to the node process, yikes!
```

## check if a service is (running && accessible) on a target ip (ip can be local or public (both tested), yo!!)

```bash
# for checking port connection of remote system
telnet 192.168.18.5 3000

# for checking port of my own system
telnet localhost 3000
```

## learn htop

Run `htop`

- You can use `q` to quit.
- You can use `u` key to show users of a particular user. Its helpful say when you have several users and you wanna see who's consuming maximum resources of cpu becoz of some db's or servers running by those users.
- You can use `f2` which is **Setup** to make the ui according to what you need: say you may add `Cpu Average` to you ui. Tip: Use space to select and move items. You may turn off tree mode as well coz it kinda make ui too dense. You may also set "Tree view is collapsed by default"
- You can use pgUp and pgDown to quickly move across page in htop coz up/down arrows are kinda lazy to use.
- You can check environment variables for a process by pressing `s`
- You can press `t` to toggle tree mode.
- You may use `k` to send some signal to a process (say kill signal)
- You can use filter `f4` and search `f3`. Tip: (filter does what array.filter methods does in javascript) where as search will keep showing all results on screen but move your cursor to matching process name as you type.
- You can help view below info via `h`:

## make a script to be run by root user only

SOA (Stackoverflow Answer): [Click here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18216122/10012446)

Implementation: [Click here](https://github.com/sahilrajput03/config/blob/main/.bash_nginx#L34-L35)

For simple example (I need to be logged in as root i.e, I should run command `su` before editing the nginx.conf file so that nvim loads all extensions, and syntax highlight, etc i.e, load `~/nvim/init.vim` file becoz by default `sudo nvim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf` doesn't load nvim user config file):

```bash
# We need to become root `su` so that all vim extensions and syntax highlight can work with nginx, ~Sahil
vi.nx() {
	# Learn uid of root user is always 0
	if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then echo "Please become root user first via 'su' command. ~Sahil"; return; fi

	nvim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
}
```

So running above fn will return if the user has not run `su` command before running the `vi.nx` from cli.

## Cannot type in termnal after pressing ctrl+c on any running program?

Simply use `reset` command to get your teminal back. YO!!  [Source](https://superuser.com/a/237405)

## Confused with all the paths in scripts?

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Prints the directory from which the script is executed, i.e., EXECUTION_PATH
echo $PWD

# Prints the relative DIRECTORY PATH of this file
dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"

# Prints the relative FILE PATH w.r.t the EXECUTION_PATH
echo ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}
```

#### Making pure executable scripts

So, below script will cause to execute the `sops` command to run from the parent directory of the `scripts` directory at all times no matter where do you execute the script from.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
SCRIPTS_DIR_PATH=$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")
cd $SCRIPTS_DIR_PATH/..
sops -e .env > enc.env
```

## Using softlink to create a binary link in `/usr/bin` directory to make binaris available from everywhere

```bash
# example 1
# Make a soft link of `docker-compose` to /usr/bin directory
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose

# example 2 (TIP: Always use absolute paths while making soft links):
sudo ln -s /home/array/test/c.sh /usr/bin/c.sh

# YOU SHOULD NOT DO IT THIS WAY:
cd ~/test/
sudo ln -s ./c.sh /usr/bin/c.sh
# ALERT: THIS IS BAD BECOZ `ln` COMMAND EXPECTED YOU TO PASS ALL PATHS AS ABSOLUTE PATH ONLY! THUS ABOVE COMMAND WOULD MAKE A BAD SOFT LINK WHICH WON'T WORK.

# REMOVING SOFT LINKS
sudo rm /usr/bin/c.sh
```

## Good use of `trap` command

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -x

# Run tailwindcss with watch mode and go to background
tailwindcss -w -i ./app/static/src/main.css -o ./app/static/dist/main.css --minify &

flask run

trap 'pkill -ef tailwind' exit
```

## what is `set -x`

Source: [Stackoverflow answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36273740/10012446)

> `set -x` enables a mode of the shell where all executed commands are printed to the terminal. In your case it's clearly used for debugging, which is a typical use case for set -x: printing every command as it is executed may help you to visualize the control flow of the script if it is not functioning as expected.

`set +x` disables it.

## tmux can be used over ssh on mobile using `Juice SSh` app

Yes, pretty amazing experience!

## gzip - a gnu cli tool to compress

Source: `Fireship.io` & https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-extract-unzip-tar-gz-file/.

`gzip` can compress only files.

```bash

# COMPRESSING A DIRECTORY: src: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/93158/504112
tar -zcvf archive.tar.gz directory/ 
# LEARN: 
# compress it using the z (gzip) algorithm
# c (create) an archive from the files in directory (tar is recursive by default)
# v (verbosely) list (on /dev/stderr so it doesn't affect piped commands) all the files it adds to the archive.
# and store the output as a f (file) named archive.tar.gz


# COMPRESSING TO A TARGET FILE
gzip -c a.txt > a.gz
ls
 # OUTPUT: a.txt a.gz
 
# COMPRESSING (by deafult gzip compresses files in place)
gzip array.png
ls
# OUTPUT: array.png.gz


# -l to list the compression ratio (higher the ratio more will be the size reduced):
gzip -l array.png.gz
# Output:
#	compressed        uncompressed  ratio uncompressed_name
#       2724                2735   1.4% array.png

# Decompressing
gzip -d array.png.gz
ls
# Output: array.png

# compressing again
gzip array.png

# Another way to decompress
gunzip array.png.gz

ls
# Output: array.png

#########
# In real world we need to archive a folder but gzip can only compress files so for that reason we need a archiver like `tar`. 
# FYI: The word `tar` for the program is derived from "tape archiver" though.
# Tar is program that can covert directories to a single file called tarball

# Usage (-z flag is to compress as well)
tar -czvf stuff.tar.gz scenes 
ls
# Output: scenes  stuff.tar.gz

# Uncompress and untar
tar -xvf stuff.tar
#FYI:
# -x, --extract, --get       extract files from an archive
# -f, --file=ARCHIVE         use archive file or device ARCHIVE
# -v, --verbose              verbosely list files processed
```

## Check if a user has password set or not?

Source: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/184975/504112

```bash
# check for postgres user:
sudo passwd --status postgres
# Output: postgres L 2021-12-17 -1 -1 -1 -1
# Analyse: Since we can not find `NP` in above output that means there password is already set for postgres user.
```

## Learn alsamixer, #MASTER alsamixer and pulseaudio
  
  - Yyou can toggle mute any device with `m`.
  - You can toggle sound card with `s` or via `f6`.
  - You increase sound with `w` and decrease with `x` of any device. FYI: Use `q`/`z` and `e`/`c` for each side speakers. Yo!
  - You can play sound throught two devices (say laptop speaker and earphone) as well i.e., unmute any the other device  and then increase the sound. 
  - If you messed any settings like volume control or any sort of thing you can simply reset things with `pulseaudio -k` command (this restarts pulseaudio with default settings for all sound cards).

Why even use `makefile` instead of some script file say `makefile.sh`?

Amazing complete answer @ [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3798609/10012446).

**tldr**

> The general idea is that make supports (reasonably) minimal rebuilds -- i.e., you tell it what parts of your program depend on what other parts. When you update some part of the program, it only rebuilds the parts that depend on that. While you could do this with a shell script, it would be a lot more work (explicitly checking the last-modified dates on all the files, etc.) The only obvious alternative with a shell script is to rebuild everything every time.

## Create a systemd service which you can setup to be run on system boot as well

[Motivation -  Autostarting ~ Arch Docs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/autostarting)

Src: [One](https://medium.com/@benmorel/creating-a-linux-service-with-systemd-611b5c8b91d6), [Two](https://tecadmin.net/run-shell-script-as-systemd-service/).

1. Create a script

```bash
vi ~/test/nf.sh
sudo chmod +x ~/test/nf.sh
```

*Now paste below text to that file*

```bash
while true; do
	echo "Hello $(date)" >> /tmp/tmp
	sleep 2
done
```

2. Create a service file, by

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/systemd/system/nf.service
```

*Now paste below text to that file*

```
[Unit]
Description=This is fun service description, sahil.

[Service]
User=array
# WorkingDirectory=/home/array/test
ExecStart=bash /home/array/test/nf.sh
Restart=always
# Restart defines no. consistent attempts to be done by systemd anytime to start the service anytime the service is killed by some external action(i.e., `systemctl stop` will not trigger restart actions).

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**or run a npm command:**
```
[Unit]
Description=This is fun service description, sahil.

[Service]
User=array
WorkingDirectory=/home/array/test/LemonJamsBot
ExecStart=npm run dev
Restart=always
# Restart defines no. consistent attempts to be done by systemd anytime to start the service anytime the service is killed by some external action(i.e., `systemctl stop` will not trigger restart actions).

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


3. Now we need to reload service by `systemd` so it loads our new service and then we can start our service:

```bash
# we need to reload systemd files
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start nf
# or we can use `sudo systemctl start nf.service`

# See status, logs from the program, age of the process (since last start), and more:
sudo systemctl status nf

# You can follow live logs for the service via (node: order of options i.e, -fu is important), src: https://superuser.com/a/1292767/776589
# fyi: This keeps logging output if you restart the service via: `sudo systemctl restart nf` yikes!!!
journalctl -fu nf

# Fyi: you can setup this service to run on system startup as well
sudo systemctl enable nf
```

Now we can check if the dates are added in the `/tmp/tmp` file by

```bash
cat /tmp/tmp
```

## Want to know your disk usage and free disk space

## Q. Why vim freezes when I press `ctrl+s` in some versions of debian/ubuntu/rapberryos ?

Ans. Because by default `ctrl+s` is a signal to freeze terminal, yes its vim independent. Source: https://blog.marcinchwedczuk.pl/how-to-fix-vim-freezes#:~:text=To%20unfreeze%20program%20you%20must%20press%20Ctrl%2BQ%20.&text=It%20still%20happens%20from%20time,Q%20and%20continue%20my%20work.

```bash
for i in {1..100}; do echo "$i"; sleep 0.3; done
# now if you press ctrl+s, the terminal will freeze ASAP, to get it back you need to press ctrl+q.

# SO basically in vim's freeze (which is basically complete terminal freeze) you just need to press ctrl+q to get back.

## softlink vs. hardlink

Source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/185915/10012446

I would point you to Wikipedia:

[Symbolic link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link)
[Hard link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link)

A few points:

- Symlinks, unlike hard links, can cross filesystems (most of the time).
- Symlinks can point to directories.
- Hard links point to a file and enable you to refer to the same file with more than one name.
- As long as there is at least one link, the data is still available.

```bash
ln -s myfile newLinkNameHere

ls -l myFile newLinkNameHere
# Output:
# .rw-r--r-- 0 array 30 Apr 15:52 myFile
# lrwxrwxrwx 6 array 30 Apr 15:52 newLinkNameHere -> myFile

# FYI:
# myFile can be folder as well.
# newLinkNameHere will be created automatically.
```

## Want a random temp file in `/tmp/` directory?

```bash
  -d, --directory     create a directory, not a file
  -u, --dry-run       do not create anything; merely print a name (unsafe)

####### BACKING UP node_modules to temporary place for some time #####
# MOVE NODE_MODULES TO TEMPORARY PLACE TO AVOID COPYING IT
TEMP=$(mktemp -d)
mv /home/array/scripts/bull/node_modules $TEMP
# Backup scripts directory
\cp -r $_home/scripts $backup_dir/
echo "Backup of ~/scripts directory succeeded."
# MOVE NODE_MODULES BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL PLACE
mv $TEMP/node_modules /home/array/scripts/bull/
```


```bash
mktemp
# Output: /tmp/tmp.VVmWziFwYh

# Usage in scripts:
cache=$(mktemp)

# Set trap to clean up file
trap 'rm -f -- "$TMP_FILE"' EXIT

# You may use this newly created file now.
#### after work done use below command to remove the file
rm -f ${cookie_file}

## What is the user `${myVariable}` when we can achieve `$myVariable` ?

NO YOU are wrong, they `${` is helpful in cases where `$myVariable` fails, for e.g., 

```bash

echo "The name of the person is $name_"
# Output:
# The name of the person is
#FYI: Can't get variable bcoz bash is trying to fetch variable name_ variable instead of name

### SO WE CAN FIX THIS VIA: ${ syntax
echo "The name of the person is ${name}_"
# Output:

#### OTHER INTERESTING AND USERFUL CASES FROM ${ syntax is:
${variable}		This command substitutes the value of the variable.
${variable:-word}	If a variable is null or if it is not set, word is substituted for variable. The value of the variable does not change.
${variable:=word}	If a variable is null or if it is not set, the value of the variable is set to word.
${variable:?message}	If a variable is null or if it is not set, the message is printed to the standard bash error.
${variable:+word}	If variable is set, word is substituted for variable. However, the value of the variable itself does not change.

## What does shift do in bash?

```bash
# shift/unshift, pop/push are general terms across all programming languages
# This will remove the first argument and will move all to the top:
shift 1
```

```bash
cat t
echo $1
shift 1
echo $1

# Output:
./t one two three
#Output:
# one
# two

```

```bash
cat t
echo $@
shift 1
echo $@

# Testing:
./t one two three
#Output:
# one two three
# two three

```

```js
a = [10, 20, 30]

a.shift()
log(a)
# Output: [20, 30]

a.shift()
log(a)
# Output: 20
```

## Rewrite existing line with carriage return character (get help from: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/26576/how-to-delete-line-with-echo)

```bash
# Way1
echo -n "Sahil is cool and creative."
sleep 1
echo -ne '\rEveryone rocks.'


# Way2 ( this works but some tab is echoed out so if way1 works for you then use that)
echo -n Bash;sleep 1;echo -ne "\033[2K"; echo -n Rocks
echo -n Bash;sleep 1;echo -ne "\033[1K"; echo -n Rocks
```

## Deleting letters in bash

## What is `/proc/` directory in linux?

You can find all the resources in use by any process (say pid 1034) by going to `/proc/1034/` directory. Also there are bunch of things there, ong interesting is the `fd` directory that manages the stdin (0), stdout(1), stderr(2) and more other file desriptiors for that process there.

## Echo to stderr

```
# src: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2990533/10012446
echoerr() { echo "$@" 1>&2; }

echoerr I am error message!
```

## Check if program exists

```bash
[ "$(type workrave 2> /dev/null)" ]; echo $?
# Output: 0

[ "$(type bad_program_name 2> /dev/null)" ]; echo $?
# Output: 1

# exit code 0 means TRUE (program exists)
# exit code 1 means FALSE (program doesn't exists)

###USAGE:
# Running workrave (if installed)
[ "$(type workrave 2> /dev/null)" ] && (workrave &)

# Bad program test (should not cause login execution error)
[ "$(type bad_program 2> /dev/null)" ] && (bad_program &)
```

./manifests/secret.enc.yaml:sops:

# fyi:
type searchTextInFilesRecursively

## `test` in bash 

Manual pages: [Click here](test-manual-pages.txt)

```bash
# source: from above `man test` command
       -n STRING
              the length of STRING is nonzero

       STRING equivalent to -n STRING

       -z STRING
              the length of STRING is zero
	      
### WOW, INTERESTING FACT here...
# -n STRING and STRING are equivalent, that means you can simply use 
test "$USER"
echo $?
# Output: 0 (exit code is 0 (TRUE), bocz user string exists in system environment variables)

test "$NON_EXISTENT"
echo $?
# Output: 1 (exit code is 1 (FALSE), bcoz NON_EXISTENT variable doesn't exist)
```

## What exactly is `<()` in bash (`=()` in zsh)?

tldp docs: https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html

This is called process substitution.

The <(list) syntax is supported by both, bash and zsh. It provides a way to pass the output of a command (list) to another command when using a pipe (|) is not possible. For example when a command just does not support input from STDIN or you need the output of multiple commands:

```bash
diff <(ls dirA) <(ls dirB)
```
<(list) connects the output of list with a file in /dev/fd, if supported by the system, otherwise a named pipe (FIFO) is used (which also depends on support by the system; neither manual says what happens if both mechanisms are not supported, presumably it aborts with an error). The name of the file is then passed as argument on the command line.

## Network utility is awesome

source: https://linuxize.com/post/netcat-nc-command-with-examples/

Use case 1: Chat app

```bash
# terminal 1 (listener)
nc -l 8080

# terminal 2 (sender)
nc localhost 8080

#### now you can send messages to and from each other, yo!!
```

Use case 2: Sending file (this can be usefult to send .tar or any encrypted+archived file easily)

Source: https://linuxize.com/post/netcat-nc-command-with-examples/

```bash
# Receiver starts a server which listens on 1337
nc -l 1337 > what.txt

# Snder send a file to some remote host(in our case its our localhost, yo!!)
nc localhost 1337 < .gitconfig
```

**This can be used to test curl request locally as well:**

```bash
# terminal 1(receiver)
nc -l 8080

# terminal 2 (sender)
curl localhost:8080 -d '{"message": "life is amazing"}'

### terminal 1's output
# POST / HTTP/1.1
# Host: localhost:8080
# User-Agent: curl/7.82.0
# Accept: */*
# Content-Length: 30
# Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
# 
# {"message": "life is amazing"}
```

## to instantly install a executable binary to a path directory

```bash
install dothis ~/.local/bin/
# now you can start using dothis binary (without bash restart)
# NOTE: If you edit the file present in current directory, it won't change the file at ~/.local/bin so BEAWARE OF THAT!


dothis
# Output: works as expected!
```

## get last n number of lines from `$HISTFILE` along with line number

This is helpful to execute a particular command using the number of that command.

```bash
fc -l -1000

# fyi: in javascript, btoa() is used to encode

# Decoding (-d short for --decode)
echo -n sahil | base64 | base64 -d
# Output: sahil
# fyi: in javascript, atob() is used to decode

# Encoding file
base64 myFile.txt

# Decoding file
base64 myFile.txt | base64 -d
# Output: <contents of the file>

## `mv` learnings:

- Consider you are moving 10 gb of data from your drive to hdd or ssd, and say you cancel the command in the middle so you don't loose anything in the source place though because mv only first copies all files to target and only delete the source files if the all copying process is completed, yikes!
- Always delete nested `node_modules` before copying any project to extenal hard disk, using my below aliases:

## Managing processes with `kill`, `pgrep` and `pkill`

Source 1: https://sahilrajput03.github.io/BashNotesForProfessionals.pdf
Source 2: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8987063

**1. Learn `pgrep`:**

```bash
# USAGE
pid PROCESS_NAME_HERE
# OUTPUT: process id of all the matched processes (pid)

# CLI OPTIONS-
# -f : to match inside "full command line" instead of just "process name"
# -l, --list-name           list PID and process name
# -a, --list-full           list PID and full command line

pgrep battery-status
# OUTPUT: ---No output bcoz pgrep matches against the process names only and in "battery-status" case the process name is `sh`

pgrep -f battery-status
# OUTPUT: 824

pgrep -fl battery-status
# OUTPUT: 824 sh

pgrep -fa battery-status
# OUTPUT: 824 sh /home/array/scripts/battery-alert/battery-status.sh

pgrep copyq
# OUTPUT:
# 839
# 1104
# 1111

pgrep copyq
# OUTPUT:
# 358507
# 358512
# 358514
```

**2. Important thought about signals from kill command:**

```bash
man kill
# OUTPUT
# The command kill sends the specified signal to the specified processes or process groups.
# 
# If no signal is specified, the TERM signal is sent. The default action for this signal is to terminate the process. This signal should be used in preference to the KILL signal
# (number 9), since a process may install a handler for the TERM signal in order to perform clean-up steps before terminating in an orderly fashion. If a process does not
# terminate after a TERM signal has been sent, then the KILL signal may be used; be aware that the latter signal cannot be caught, and so does not give the target process the
# opportunity to perform any clean-up before terminating.
# 
# Most modern shells have a builtin kill command, with a usage rather similar to that of the command described here. The --all, --pid, and --queue options, and the possibility to
# specify processes by command name, are local extensions.
```

**3. Learn pkill - Start and kill processes:**

```bash
# NOTE: PLEASE LEAR `pgrep` from above section first coz `pgrep`, `pkill` and `pwait` are family commands i.e., they use same input option parameters on command line ~ Sahil ~ source: `man pkill`
####### WAY 1: Pro Linux User Way
pkill -ef test.py
# CLI OPTIONS-
# -e : echo what is killed (i.e., verbose)
# -f : to match inside "full command line" instead of just "process name"

########## WAY 2: FOOL'S WAY: MANUALLY KILLING by search doing a manual search through `pgrep` for the `process-id` and then killing via `kill` command
pgrep -f battery-status.sh

kill $(pgrep -f 'python test.py')
kill $(pgrep -f battery-status.sh)
```

**4. Check if a process if running already?**

```bash
# Unit tests for how `test` (i.e., `[`) command works
# ===================================================
pid=$(pgrep -f battery-status.sh)
echo "$pid"	# TIP: Check for non-empty string

# 1. False returning
test -z "$pid" && echo "Process is *NOT* running.."
if [ -z "$pid" ]; then echo "Process is *NOT* running.."; fi
test -z "$pid"; echo $?
#FYI: Outputs 1 when pid has some value(i.e, process is running) coz -z checks for empty sting.

# 2. True returning
test ! -z "$pid" && echo Process is running..
if ! [ -z "$pid" ]; then echo "Process is *running*.."; fi
if ! [ -z "$pid" ]; then echo "Process is *running*.."; else echo "Process is *NOT* running"; fi

# Using -n instead of using -z and then inverting if using ! unlike above
if [ -n "$pid" ]; then echo "Process is *running*.."; else echo "Process is *NOT* running"; fi

# Inline command
# ==============
if [ -n "$(pgrep -f battery-status.sh)" ]; then echo "Process is *running*.."; else echo "Process is *NOT* running"; fi
# or simply
if [ -n "$(pgrep -f battery-status)" ]; then echo "Process is *running*.."; else echo "Process is *NOT* running"; fi

# Mischiveous options used with `if`
# ==================================
# -n to check non-zero length string
# -z with ! operator to check for non-zero length string bcoz -z check for zero length strings
# Using -z will make program exit with 0 if string is empty
```
## Expand your alias in shell lively before your eyes ?

```bash
myAlias<ctrl+alt+e>
```

## Make script's realative path work even when the script is executed from different path

You can make use of:

```
lines=$(wc -l $(dirname $0)/must-can |  awk '{print $1}')
# src: vi ~/scripts-in-use/td/s.sh

# Here $dirname $0 will get the path of the script and then we append the relative path for any path relative to the script we are executing.
# It works good!!
```

## print commands automatically before running them:

**way0-BEST**

Use manual echo logs to do it!

**way1**

```
myFun(){
trap 'echo "+ $BASH_COMMAND"' DEBUG
# my commands here..
# my commands here..

trap - DEBUG
}

# THIS WORKS GOOD THOUGH!
# trap - DEBUG is to reset the environment.
# DRAWBACK: trap - DEBUG is printed as well.
```

**way2**

```
set -x;
command1;
command2;
set +x;

# FYI: THIS IS NOT WORKING GOOD(prints clutters as well) ACCORDING TO MY ENVIONMENT! ~Sahil
# set +x is to reset the environment.
# DRAWBACK: set +x is printed as well.
```

**way3**

`-v` is move verbose as compared to `-x`

```
set -v;
command1;
command2;
set +v;

# FYI: THIS IS NOT WORKING GOOD(prints clutters as well) ACCORDING TO MY ENVIONMENT! ~Sahil
# set +v is to reset the environment.
# DRAWBACK: set +v is printed as well.
```

**way4**

We can use `-x` or `-v` when calling the shebang in any script as well:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -x
# or
#!/bin/bash -v
```

## record your terminal sessions the right way

## using `column` to tool

This can be helpful to align unaligned column from some file

```bash
cat data.dat
1 3 3
3    5 44

column -t data.dat
1  3  3
3  5  44
```

## Avail all your aliases and funcion in bash scripts

You need to use below commands. **FYI: You can use place these commands before the interactive shell return statement in your .bashrc file as well for ONE TIME SOLUTION.**

Source: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/1498/504112

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# file myscript.sh
source ~/.bash_aliases
source ~/.bash_functions
shopt -s expand_aliases

### now you can access all your aliaes and funcions below:
...
```

## Running any bash script interactively

```bash
#!/bin/bash -i
nf
# Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the expand_aliases shell option is set using shopt (see the description of shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
## source: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/1498/504112
```

## `tac` 

Prints the content of a file exactly like cat but in reverse order of lines.

```bash
tac file
```

## `sha1sum`

Source: https://askubuntu.com/a/61828/702911

```bash
# Generating sha256 for some text: source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3358428/10012446
echo -n foobar | sha256sum
```

FYI: `SHA-1` is less secure than `SHA-256` and `SHA-3`. Source: click [here](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html) and [here](https://shattered.it/).

***Any sha1 `digest` is 40 chars long in length.***

```
echo Hello > file.txt
sha1sum  file.txt > sha-verify
# check files
ls
# Output:
file.txt  sha-verify

# view contents of `sha-verify`
cat sha-verify
f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f  file.txt

sha1sum -c sha-verify
# Output:
file.txt: OK
```

E.g.2:

```
echo hello > 1
echo hello > 2

sha 1 2 > sha-verify

ls
1  2  sha-verify

cat sha-verify
# Output:
f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f  1
f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f  2

sha1sum -c sha-verify
# Output:
1: OK
2: OK
```

**Also from the man pages of `sha1sum`:**

```txt
BUGS
       Do  not use the SHA-1 algorithm for security related purposes.  Instead,
       use an  SHA-2  algorithm,  implemented  in  the  programs  sha224sum(1),
       sha256sum(1),  sha384sum(1),  sha512sum(1), or the BLAKE2 algorithm, im‐
       plemented in b2sum(1)
```

```
## random with `shuf`

```
# print two random files (pass `-r` option if you want lines can be repeated as well)
shuf -n 2 myFile.txt

# print random order of input numbers from 1 to 10.
shuf -i 1-10

# print a single random number from 1 to 10
shuf -i 1-10 -n 1

# print a two random number from 1 to 10
shuf -i 1-10 -n 2

# Shuf manual:
#       -i, --input-range=LO-HI
#              treat each number LO through HI as an input line
#       -n, --head-count=COUNT
#              output at most COUNT lines

## Using rg's flags to define functions

```bash
# To diable .git and node_module folders everywhere, I have below line in my .bashrc file. WARN: Dont forget to source the .bashrc file after adding this:
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND="rg --files --follow --no-ignore-vcs --hidden -g '!{**/node_modules/*,**/.git/*}'"


## From man pages of rg:

       --no-ignore-vcs
           Don’t respect version control ignore files (.gitignore, etc.). This implies --no-ignore-parent for VCS files. Note
           that .ignore files will continue to be respected.


       --files
           Print each file that would be searched without actually performing the search. This is useful to determine whether a
           particular file is being searched or not.


       -L, --follow
           When this flag is enabled, ripgrep will follow symbolic links while traversing directories. This is disabled by
           default. Note that ripgrep will check for symbolic link loops and report errors if it finds one.

           This flag can be disabled with --no-follow.



       -., --hidden
           Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories are skipped. Note that if a hidden file
           or a directory is whitelisted in an ignore file, then it will be searched even if this flag isn’t provided.

           A file or directory is considered hidden if its base name starts with a dot character (.). On operating systems which
           support a hidden file attribute, like Windows, files with this attribute are also considered hidden.

           This flag can be disabled with --no-hidden.




       -g, --glob GLOB ...
           Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the given glob. This always overrides any other
           ignore logic. Multiple glob flags may be used. Globbing rules match .gitignore globs. Precede a glob with a ! to
           exclude it. If multiple globs match a file or directory, the glob given later in the command line takes precedence.

           As an extension, globs support specifying alternatives: -g ab{c,d} is equivalet to -g abc -g abd. Empty alternatives
           like -g ab{,c} are not currently supported. Note that this syntax extension is also currently enabled in gitignore
           files, even though this syntax isn’t supported by git itself. ripgrep may disable this syntax extension in gitignore
           files, but it will always remain available via the -g/--glob flag.

           When this flag is set, every file and directory is applied to it to test for a match. So for example, if you only want
           to search in a particular directory foo, then -g foo is incorrect because foo/bar does not match the glob foo.
           Instead, you should use -g 'foo/**'.
```

## Using `wc`

```bash
wc myFile.txt
# Output:
  653  2809 23209 myFile.txt
  ^Line ^words ^chars ^myFile.txt

wc -l
# Output: #Tells only about total number of lines
23209 myFile.txt

wc -w #Tells only about words
23209 myFile.txt


wc -c m #Tells only about characters
# Output:
23209 myFile.txt
```

## Bash shortcuts

Source: https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-keyboard.html

## Usage of xargs

```bash
$ cat file.txt
I am Sahil.
You are foo.
He is bar.

# With xargs we can pass any stdout or file's content to any command we want like this:
$ cat file.txt | xargs echo
I am Sahil. You are foo. He is bar.

# FYI: This will NOT work at all:
$ cat file.txt | echo
# Output: NO OUTPUT.
```

## making use of `bc` - a command line calculator

```bash
# bc is berkely calculator cli too:
$ echo "2+3" | bc -l
5

$ cat file.txt
5
3
2

$ paste -sd+ file.txt
5+3+2

$ paste -sd+ file.txt | bc -l
10
```

## Using `paste` to join multiple lines to a single line

```bash
$ cat file.txt
line1
line2
line3

# With s option we are saying to join lines to single line, and 
# with option d we are saying to use , as delimiter for joining.
$ paste -s -d, file.txt
line1,line2,line3
```

## head / tail 

```bash
#usage:
head -n10 #Gets first 10 lines
tail -n10 #Gets last 10 lines
```

## `sort` and `uniq` tool is linux

```bash
$ cat test.txt
z
y
x
b
a

# Simple sorting with sort cli:
$ sort test.txt
a
b
x
y
z
```

```bash
$ cat test.txt
z
y
y
y
y
x
b
a
a
a
a
a

$ sort test.txt | uniq
a
b
x
y
z

# Count the duplicate occurences as well with -c option in uniq cli:
$ sort test.txt | uniq -c
      5 a
      1 b
      1 x
      4 y
      1 z
      

# We can sort these entries by their count nubmers as well:
# FYI: I modified the duplicate entries so thats why the duplicate count has changed like that:
$ sort test.txt | uniq -c | sort
      1 x
      2 a
      3 z
      4 y
      6 b
```

## `sed` with `find`, `grep` and `xargs`

`sed` vs. `awk` both are stream editors but `awk` is mostly valuable in times when you want to work with data in terms of columns(you can manage dynamic no. of column size in it usiing if/else loops coz its full programming language though). And in general `sed` is used with regex patterns inscribed in it for string substitution(replace) and get specific details from it using the group thing (which is pretty complex though, lean this group technique to get partial data from the record [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz_dsktIjt4)).

`Awk` is abbreviated from the names of the developers – Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan.

`sed` stands *stream editor*, yes that means find, modify or replace text or do all together with the use of pipe interface(though we can use files directly to operate on them too).

```bash
sed -i 's/\b[0-9]\{3\}\b/number/g' file.txt
# In above you need to learn that (you can run below regex test in browser though):
# /[0-9]{3}/.test('my text 12') // false (coz we are testing three numeric digits with {3} pattern in there.! Yikes!
# /[0-9]{3}/.test('my 789 text') // true
```

All the options discussed are [from this arcticle - How to Use sed to Find and Replace String in Files](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-string-in-files/#disqus_thread).

```bash

$ man find #Searching for `-exec` option help section:
# Output:
#        -exec command {} +
#               This  variant of the -exec action runs the specified command on the selected
#               files, but the command line is built by appending each selected file name at
#               the  end;  the  total number of invocations of the command will be much less
#               than the number of matched files.  The command line is  built  in  much  the
#               same  way that xargs builds its command lines.  Only one instance of `{}' is
#               allowed within the command, and it must appear at the end,  immediately  be‐
#               fore  the  `+';  it needs to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect it
#               from interpretation by the shell.  The command is executed in  the  starting
#               directory.   If any invocation with the `+' form returns a non-zero value as
#               exit status, then find returns a non-zero exit status.  If  find  encounters
#               an  error,  this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some pending com‐
#               mands  may  not  be   run   at   all.    For   this   reason   -exec my-com‐
#               mand ... {} + -quit  may  not result in my-command actually being run.  This
#               variant of -exec always returns true.


# ~Sahil ? What is ```-exec``` option used for??
# Also `-exec` is used to execute any command which we pass as arguments to -exec option and
# we can reaplace the filename with {} symboly and end the command by + symbol. ALL THIS IS

# Using grep

$ man grep
# Output: (for -r, -l and -Z options)

#       -r, --recursive
#              Read all files under each directory, recursively, following  symbolic  links
#              only  if  they  are  on  the  command line.  Note that if no file operand is
#              given, B<grep> searches the working directory.  This is equivalent to the -d
#              recurse option.
#              
#       -l, --files-with-matches
#              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which
#              output would normally have been printed.  Scanning  each  input  file  stops
#              upon first match.
#              
#       -Z, --null
#              Output  a  zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the character that
#              normally follows a file name.  For example, grep -lZ  outputs  a  zero  byte
#              after  each  file  name instead of the usual newline.  This option makes the
#              output unambiguous, even in the presence of file  names  containing  unusual
#              characters  like  newlines.  This option can be used with commands like find
#              -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and xargs -0 to  process  arbitrary  file  names,
#              even those that contain newline characters.
#       -n, --line-number
#              Prefix  each  line  of output with the 1-based line number
#              within its input file.

## Play with time ?

***Whats epoch time ?*** Ans. *Time in seconds sice `1/1/1970 @ 00:00:00 UTC`*. Also known as *Unix time* or *Posix time*.

***IST ?*** Ans. *Indian Standard Time*.

***`@` is prefixed before epoch time.***

TIMEZONES:

```bash
# Docs of date: https://man.archlinux.org/man/date.1.en

#Shows list of timezones
timedatectl list-timezones

#Find
timedatectl list-timezones | grep -i Kolkata
# Output: Asia/Kolkata

# Find complete list of tz database with their gmt and timezone code @
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

#Amazing converter site

```


```bash
#>>> CURRENT TIME
date       #Get current date/time stamp in local time
#OUTPUT: Fri Feb  4 01:32:02 PM IST 2022

date -u    #Get current date/time stamp utc
#OUTPUT: Fri Feb  4 08:02:02 AM UTC 2022

date +\%s  #Current date/time in Epoch time


#>>> CONVERSIONS
#NOTE: @ is prefixed before epoch time.
#NOTE: All below times are returned in local time using timezone set in my machine unless you specify `-u` to return in UTC time.

### Convert Epoch time to human readable format.
date -d @0
#OUTPUT: Thu Jan  1 05:30:00 AM IST 1970         #Output is local time. (IST stands for Indian Standard Time)

date -d @1643960274
#OUTPUT: Fri Feb  4 01:07:54 PM IST 2022         #Output is local time. (IST stands for Indian Standard Time)

date -d @$(date +\%s)
#OUTPUT: Fri Feb  4 01:16:02 PM IST 2022 #FYI: THIS IS THE SAME OUTPUT WE GET FROM 'date' command directly.



### GET CURRENT TIME IN A DIFFERENT TIME ZONE
TZ=Asia/Kolkata date      #This would be redundant coz just `date` would give me time in IST by default.
#OUTPUT: Fri Feb  4 02:14:49 PM IST 2022

## Using arrays in bash

[Wow source!](https://opensource.com/article/18/5/you-dont-know-bash-intro-bash-arrays)

```bash
# Syntax        # Result
arr=()          # Create an empty array
arr=(1 2 3)     # Initialize array
${arr[2]}       # Retrieve third element
${arr[@]}       # Retrieve all elements
${!arr[@]}      # Retrieve array indices
${#arr[@]}      # Calculate array size
arr[0]=3        # Overwrite 1st element
arr+=(4)        # Append value(s)
str=$(ls)       # Save ls output as a string
arr=( $(ls) )   # Save ls output as an array of files       #Didn't work in my case ~ Sahil
${arr[@]:s:n}   # Retrieve n elements starting at index s   #Didn't work in my case ~ Sahil

# ::LOOP OVER ARRAY ITEMS::
# TAGS: #foreach, #forin, #for each, #for loop

# Eg.0: Range example
for t in {1..3}; do
	echo hello $t
done
# OUTPUT:
# hello 1
# hello 2
# hello 3

# Eg.1: Learn: Ranges in bash (array)
for t in 1 2; do
	echo hello $t
done
# OUTPUT:
# hello 1
# hello 2


# Eg.2: Learn: Simple looping over array
arr=(1 10 100)
for t in ${arr[@]}; do
	echo $t
done
# OUTPUT:
# 1
# 10
# 100

# Eg.3: Looping over array of strings with spaces, src: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18383346/10012446
a="I am foo"
b="I am bar"
all=("$a" "$b")
for t in "${all[@]}"; do
	echo Message: $t
done
# OUTPUT: 
# Message: I am foo
# Message: I am bar

# Eg.4: Looping over array of strings with spaces (DUPLICATE of above) You can also define the strings with spaces in array by:
all=("a b" "c d")
for t in "${all[@]}" ; do
  echo "What $t"

# OUTPUT:
# What a b
# What c d
```

**Usage of `COPROC` **

[Source](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-co-processes). Inspiration: [here](https://github.com/denilsonsa/small_scripts/blob/master/sleep_until_modified.sh).

**Graceful exit**

> A graceful exit (or graceful handling) is a simple programming idiom wherein a program detects a serious error condition and "exits gracefully" in a controlled manner as a result. Often the program prints a descriptive error message to a terminal or log as part of the graceful exit.
Wikipedia - [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceful_exit).

**Using tee command**

```bash
man tee
# Ouput: tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files
# The tee command reads from standard input and writes it to standard output and one ore more files.
# src: https://linuxize.com/post/linux-tee-command


echo Hello I am Sahil > log
#Write to file log

echo Hello I am Sahil > log1 > log2
# Clears content of file log1 and overwrite content of log2 with text "Hello I am Sahil".
# But actually I wanted to overwrite to both log1 and log2 file with text "Hello I am Sahil".
# FYI: echo Hello I am Sahil > log2 log3 #This would be no good at all coz it'll write "Hello I am Sahil log3" to log2 file simply.


# So, we need tee for that:
echo Hello I am Sahil | tee log2 log3
# Overwrites text "Hello I am Sahil" to both log2 and log3 files.


# By default tee overwrite the target files, instead if u want to append to content of the files, you can use:
echo Hello I am Sahil | tee -a log2 log3


# Beauty of tee command is that we can repipe stdout (i.e., tee doesn't eat up the stdout or stderr at all):
echo Hello I am Sahil | tee -i log2 log3 | cat
# "Hello I am Sahil" is written to log2, log3 and on terminal as well.


# Using tee in Conjunction with sudo, src: https://linuxize.com/post/linux-tee-command/#using-tee-in-conjunction-with-sudo
sudo echo "newline" > /etc/file.conf
# Output: bash: /etc/file.conf: Permission denied
# Instead: we can do..
echo "newline" | sudo tee -a /etc/file.conf
# Using tee in conjunction with sudo allows you to write to files owned by other users.
```

**Know the filesystem usage and free space**

```bash
df -h
src: https://linuxize.com/post/linux-tee-command/

man df
# Output:
# NAME: df - report file system space usage
```


**Usage of `test` command**

To know if you are piping 

```
if test -t 1; then
    # Stdout(file description 1) is a terminal i.e., you are not doing something like `./script.sh | cat` or `./script.sh | grep someText`
    echo stdout is a terminal"
fi
```

**Usage of `exec` command**

```bash
 exec >log 2>&1
 # Will redirect stdout and stderr to a file `log` in current folder.
 # Useful when you need tract all ouput to a file forever. Src: https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-redirections-using-exec
```


**Usage of `trap COMMAND SIGNAL`**

Source: [AMMAAZZIINGG guide](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-trap-command) to full usage of `trap` command..

```bash
#!/bin/bash
trap 'rm abc.txt' exit
# 1. Will remove abc.txt file on pressing ctrl+c. 
touch abc.txt
echo Created a file abc.txt
sleep 5
echo Bye
# 2. After exiting the program the file abc.txt will be deleted anyway.

# Set a function to be executed in the trap commands ?

```


**Usage of `dirname` and `basename`:**

```
# Usage of basename and dirname in a script: src: https://github.com/denilsonsa/small_scripts/blob/master/sleep_until_modified.sh
FULLNAME="$1"
BASENAME=`basename "$FULLNAME"`
DIRNAME=`dirname "$FULLNAME"`



# Learn basename:
basename ../../.myfile.sh
# Output: .myfile.sh

basename ./.myfile.sh
# Output: .myfile.sh




# Learn dirname:
dirname ../../my-folder/myfile.sh
# Output: ../../my-folder

## `$@` vs. `$*`? What you should use.


```
# Recommened: Read original posters' full answer: https://superuser.com/a/247131/776589
$#    Stores the number of command-line arguments that 
      were passed to the shell program.
$?    Stores the exit value of the last command that was 
      executed.
$0    Stores the first word of the entered command (the 
      name of the shell program).
$*    Stores all the arguments that were entered on the
      command line ($1 $2 ...).
"$@"  Stores all the arguments that were entered
      on the command line, individually quoted ("$1" "$2" ...).


./command -yes -no /home/username
$# = 3
$* = -yes -no /home/username
$@ = array: {"-yes", "-no", "/home/username"}
$0 = ./command, $1 = -yes etc.

## Use switch cases in bash:

Eg1.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# src: https://linuxize.com/post/bash-case-statement/
echo "Enter 1 or 2 or something else..."
read choice
echo You chose $choice
echo
echo

case $choice in

  1)
  echo "case 1 executed."
    ;;

  2)
  echo "case 2 executed."
    ;;

  *)
  # This executes if none of above mathces any choice.
  echo "Default case executed."
    ;;
esac
```

Eg2.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while [ true ]
do
    echo "Enter your choice (1/2/3):"
    read choice

    greet="Great! You chose $choice"
    case $choice in
        1)
            echo $greet, One is master number.
        ;;

        2)
            echo $greet, All phenomenal things are dualistic in nature, say masculine and feminine.
        ;;

        3)
            echo $greet, Its best to have three options so that you always feel rich in anything you choose. Yo!!
        ;;

        *)
            echo Please try again, you messed with the choice.
        ;;
    esac
    echo
    echo

done

## Use grep to get only the matched patter only with `-o` flag

```
$ echo I am Sahil | grep Sahil
# Output: I am Sahil
$ echo I am Sahil | grep -o Sahil
# Output: Sahil
```

## Search process without using something like `ps -aux | grep myOldHabits` ...

```
pgrep -f battery-status   #Returns all pid's of services with text battery-status in its name.
src: https://askubuntu.com/a/612318/702911

# e.g., we can use it like 1:
kill `pgrep 1.sh` # Notice the backticks.

# e.g., we can use it like 2:
kill $(pgrep -f battery-status)     #This will kill all the returning proceses via there process ids.
```

```
echo $!
# Ouput: Prints the pid of the last process you ran (i.e., only the commands which you ran in background by suffixing wiht & in the end. I.e., ```echo Sahil &```.
```


## Using ps -aux and dont' show grep entry in that:

```
# FYI:
echo $!
# Ouput: Prints the pid of the last process you ran (i.e., only the commands which you ran in background by suffixing wiht & in the end. I.e., ```echo Sahil &```.

ps -aux | grep -v grep | grep $!
# or
ps -aux | grep $! | grep -v grep
```

## Get path of the script file that we are executing

```
MY_PATH=$(dirname "$0")
echo "$MY_PATH"

### Fun with variables

Must checkout: https://linuxize.com/post/bash-increment-decrement-variable/

```bash
## Special local variabes in bash : https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/localvar.html

# Whats wrong?
a = 10
#Ouput: a: command not found.

a =10
#Ouput: a: command not found.

a= 10
#Ouput: a: command not found.

a=10
#Ouput: <variable assignment succeed without any ouput>
### LEARNING: Spaces are NOT allowed when you assign values to variables.


# What is the pupose of (), (()), [], [[]] in bash if/while conditions ?
# Answer: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/306115/504112


# Ternary Operator
a=$([ 4 == 5 ] && echo 11 || echo 22)   #src: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3953712/10012446
# Now echo $a gives us: 22 bcoz the result of expression [ 4 == 5 ] is false.

# Other way:
[[ 4 = 5 ]] && a=11 || a=22            #src: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3953666/10012446
# Now echo $a gives us: 22 bcoz the result of expression [ 4 == 5 ] is false.

echo $x yz
# Ouput: Sahil yz

echo ${x}yz       #Concatenation variables with other string or variable.
# Ouput: Sahilyz     [Cool enough. Isn't it ?]






#String splitting, #string split, #split string, #substring

var=01234
echo ${var:3}
# Output: 34    #I.e., from index 3(including) to the end.

var=01234
echo ${var:0:4}
0123

echo ${var:1:4}
1234

echo ${var:2:4}
234

echo ${var:3:4}
34

echo ${var:4:4}
4


# tldr; using ', " and \ works good to define a string with a space.
fullName=sahil\ kolkata; echo $fullName
fullName="sahil kolkata"; echo $fullName
fullName='sahil rajput'; echo $fullName


hasMoney=true                   # In bash there is nothing like boolean, so true is just a simple string.
if [ $hasMoney = true ] ; then
    echo 'I do have money.'
fi
# ouput: I do have mone.

# Concatenation is so easy in bash, i.e., you don't need any operator like + at all, coz it just happens.
if [ "$hasMoney"1 = true1 ];
then
    echo 'I do have money.';
fi
# ouput: I do have money.


c=1; echo $c
# ouput: 1

(( c=c+1 )); echo $c
# output; 2

(( c++ )); echo $c
# ouput: 3

if (( c < 4 )); then (( c++ )); echo Incremented and new value is $c; fi
# outputt: SPECIAL:: executing above statements MULTIPLE times will increment c's value till it gets 4.
