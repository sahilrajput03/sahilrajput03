# Why you should not text your girlfriend much

1. I am replying to you while working because I don't want you to feel ignored. I would really like ki baad mei baat kren..
I think texting is way way worse than nothing at all for me at least.

**Still texting is not bad because it can still help -**

- when you want to give very urgent message to someone
- when its impossible for you to talk to them because of any sort of reason
