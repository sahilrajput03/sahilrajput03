# Learning Figma

**Pages concept**: It is an amazing concept to keep designs isloated in each page, thus you can do a large number of separate design works in a single file of figma. Yo!

**Quick actions**: `ctrl+/`

**Presentation Mode(show/hide UI)**: `ctrl+\`

**Undo/Redo/copy/cut/selectAll**: Use `ctrl+z`/`ctrl+y`/`ctrl+c`/`ctrl+x`/`ctrl+a`.

**Lock a object/objects to fix them and disable selection of them**: Select object/objects and use `ctrl+shift+l` to toggle lock/unlock. BETTER WAY IS TO USE lock icon in the ***Layers section***.

**Show help shortcuts for tools**: `Ctrl+shift+?` (or use the bottom right `?` button and select `Keyboard Shortcuts`) and switch to `Tools` tab to view the tools shortcuts. [List of all hotkeys](https://shortcuts.design/tools/toolspage-figma/).

**Hand tool - BEST WAY TO MOVE AROUND PAGE**: Hold down `space` key to activate hand tool temporarily and move the page with mouse simply.

**Zoom**: Hold down `ctrl` key to enable zoom with mouse scroll. NOTE: pgdown scroll causes to zoom out, **pageup** scroll causes to **`ZOOM-IN`** in the canvas.

**Move objects horizontally or vertically**: Select objects first hold down `shift` key and use mouse to drag them.

**Copy objects**: Select object/objects first, then hold down `alt` key and use mouse to drag the object/objects to create their copies.

**PROPORTIONALY SCALING:: Create squares or perfect circles or aligned line or aligned arros using** _rectange tool_ or _ellipse tool_ or _line_ or _arrow_: Choose *rectange tool* with `r` or *ellipse* with `o` and then hold down `shift` key and now you can draw _square_ or _perfect_ circle now.

**Set opacity of any object**: Select object and press `1` for 10%, `2` for 20% so on.. and `0` for 100%. TIP: To set opacity to 0%, press `00`

**Zoom to select region**: First press and hold `z` and then hold mouse make region to zoom into.

**Copy selected object/objects as PNG**: `Ctrl+shift+c`

## Prototyping

IMPORTANT~Sahil: You must convert a object to a component first to be able to get prototyping circle connector. You can do it via right clicking and select ***Create Component*** option or simply use `ctrl+shift+k`.

Tips:

- You can use `r` in prototyping to restart the prototype(in case of hovering you don't need to restart prototype though coz unhovering it causes to undo the effect instantly).
- Use `right mouse click` to shown options in prototype display tab.

Switch to prototype mode using hotkey `shift+e` or simply choose from the right ***Prototype*** tab in the right hand side bar.

In the ***prototype tab***, you can select one of the interactions with mouse to open its ***interaction details*** or you can simply click the prototype arrows to open it directly.

Official getting started [post of prototyping in figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma) is good though.
