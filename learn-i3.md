## Finding window name for making them float

2. ‚ô• Get only `WM_NAME`, `WM_CLASS`, `WM_WINDOW_ROLE` and `WM_WINDOW_TYPE` (source - Same above stackoverflow answer of point 1).

  `xprop2i3` is amazing you can check it here i.e, [`xprop213.sh`](https://github.com/sahilrajput03/config/blob/main/scripts/xprop2i3.sh) in my own config repository.

  Tip: You can use my **alias** for it as well ie., `xprop213.sh` as well.

3. ‚ô• To get only `WM_NAME` you can use this command too:

```bash
xprop WM\_CLASS
# Outpu:
# WM\_CLASS(STRING) = "gnome-calculator", "Gnome-calculator"

#### LEARN ####
### The first part is `instance` for i3
### The second part is `class` for i3

### so to make them float for i3 it would work like that:
for_window [instance="gnome-calculator"] floating enable
# OR
for_window [class="Gnome-calculator"] floating enable
```

## ‚ô•üíï‚ù§ New learning from monajaro-i3 installation (default setup)

1. `mod+m` makes the taskbar autohide and to see taskbar show automatically you need to press `mod` anytime you want).
2. `mod+b` toggle b/w last workspace.
3. `mod+ <anyWorkspaceNumber>` switched to target workspace but when pressed again act as switching b/w current and last workspace.

## Installed `xorg-xprop` to find info for windows

```bash
sudo pacman -S xorg-xprop

# Now you can use:
xprop
# Now use cross-hair cursor to click any window and get all the details of that window!! Its good for doing stuff (like making certain windows always float in i3 tiling manager or other similar stuff).
```


## Fixing flameshow in new manajaro-i3 install

You need to disable below lines as shown i.e, by adding a prefix of # for each of these lines:

```
# bindsym Print exec --no-startup-id i3-scrot
# bindsym $mod+Print --release exec --no-startup-id i3-scrot -w
# bindsym $mod+Shift+Print --release exec --no-startup-id i3-scrot -s
```

and you need to add this line for flameshot:

```
bindsym Print exec /usr/bin/flameshot gui
```
