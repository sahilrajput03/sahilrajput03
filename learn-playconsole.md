**PlayStore notes:**
- Country availability is changed across all tracks.
- There are some monetization and country availability exceptions for internal tests. For details, go to the section on setting up an internal test.
- Paid apps: If you’re testing a paid app using an open or closed test, testers still need to purchase it. If you’re testing a paid app using an internal test, testers can install your app for free.

## `LEARNING OF THE BAD DAY` Super learning about adding tester email to "Internal Testing"

Source:  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63253254/google-play-blank-screen-loading-forever-internal-testing-and-public-alpha-track)

It takes 3-4 hours or may be 1-2 days so that any new tester email added to `tester-email-list` to take into effect (before that it will show white screen when you try to browse the internal testing playstore link).
