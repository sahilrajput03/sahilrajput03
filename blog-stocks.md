# Socks Trading Experieces

## 7 Oct, 2023

I created my zerodha account 20 September, 2023 and I started seeing the price candles of HDFC bank.

In HDFC charts, I see that there is somewhat around 1% to 3% at max of change in price in day trading but there is around 10% change if I see chart of 1D and look for profit patterns, there is a pattern of around 15 days of so I guess.

TODO:
- learn how to view your own shares on kite
- learn how to short a stock on kite in day trading (to learn how it works, though I want to only do delivery stocks only)
- learn how to use stop loss with delivery stocks
